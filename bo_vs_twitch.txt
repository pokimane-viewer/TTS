DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL
Jurisdiction and Venue
Jurisdiction. This Court has jurisdiction over this action and the Defendant. Twitch Interactive, Inc. (“Twitch” or “Defendant”) operates its business in San Francisco, California and has its principal place of business in San Francisco County. California’s long-arm statute permits California courts to exercise personal jurisdiction “on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States” . Here, Defendant’s extensive contacts with California and the commission of wrongful acts in California give this Court personal jurisdiction.


Venue. Venue is proper in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, because Defendant’s principal offices are located in San Francisco and the causes of action arose, in substantial part, in San Francisco County. Under California law, a corporation may be sued in the county “where the obligation or liability arises, or the breach occurs; or in the county where the principal place of business of such corporation is situated.” Twitch is headquartered at 350 Bush Street in San Francisco, California, and conducts its operations in this County. Accordingly, San Francisco County is the proper venue for this action. This case is an unlimited civil case given that the amount in controversy exceeds $25,000.


Parties
Plaintiff. Plaintiff Bo Shang (hereinafter “Plaintiff”) is a natural person and a long-time user of the Twitch platform. Plaintiff used Twitch’s services for several years and was directly harmed by Twitch’s products and business practices, as described below. Plaintiff is a consumer of Twitch’s online streaming platform and a member of the general public that Twitch targets with its services. At all relevant times, Plaintiff has been a resident of the State of California (residing in the County of San Francisco).


Defendant. Defendant Twitch Interactive, Inc. (hereinafter “Twitch” or “Defendant”) is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San Francisco, California. Twitch is an online live-streaming platform primarily focused on video game content. Twitch is owned by Amazon.com, Inc., and is one of the world’s leading live streaming services, with millions of users and viewers daily. Twitch monetizes its platform through advertising and user purchases, such as paid channel subscriptions and virtual currency (“Bits”), yielding enormous revenues (estimated at approximately $1.8 billion in 2024 alone ). Twitch conducts substantial business in California, maintains offices in San Francisco, and purposefully avails itself of the California market. At all relevant times, Twitch was responsible for the design, development, operation, and maintenance of the Twitch platform and its features.


General Allegations and Statement of Facts
Twitch’s Promotion of “Gaming Disorder” Content and Extractive Business Model
Twitch Platform Overview. Twitch operates an online platform and product that streams user-generated video content, primarily video game play and related entertainment. Twitch’s service is available via website and mobile applications, which function as a product delivered to consumers for entertainment and social interaction. Users (including Plaintiff) can watch live streams, communicate via chat, and financially support streamers through subscriptions or donations. Twitch’s business success hinges on maximizing user engagement—keeping users watching streams for as long as possible and encouraging them to spend money on the platform.


“Gaming Disorder” Content Promotion. Twitch knowingly promotes and profits from content that encourages excessive and unhealthy gaming behavior, sometimes described as “gaming disorder” content. The World Health Organization (“WHO”) has officially recognized “gaming disorder” as a form of behavioral addiction, including it in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as of 2019 . Despite this, Twitch features and amplifies streams that glorify extreme gaming habits: for example, marathon gaming sessions, “no-sleep” streaming challenges, and other compulsive gaming behaviors. By highlighting and rewarding streamers who engage in such unhealthy conduct (with high viewer counts, front-page placement, or partnership deals), Twitch normalizes and encourages addictive patterns among its user base. Twitch profits from this content through advertising impressions and increased viewer spending, effectively monetizing the addictive behavior of its users.


Extractive Business Model. Twitch’s business model is fundamentally extractive: it derives revenue by exploiting users’ tendencies toward unhealthy, excessive usage of its product. Much like a casino or social media platform engineered for maximum engagement, Twitch is designed to capture and hold users’ attention for prolonged periods. The platform employs various features to achieve this, including: algorithmic recommendations that continuously feed users new streams, gamified reward systems (such as channel points, badges, leaderboards for top donors), and constant notifications to lure users back. These features are intentionally designed to foster compulsive usage. Indeed, numerous lawsuits and studies have noted that major gaming and social media companies utilize psychological research to make their products “as addictive as possible,” keeping users continuously engaged and spending money . Twitch is no exception; upon information and belief, Twitch has developed and implemented features with the specific intent to increase user “dwell time” and spending, with reckless disregard for the impact on user health.


Profiting from Unhealthy Behavior. Twitch directly profits from user behaviors that can be categorized as unhealthy or disordered. For example, Twitch earns a significant commission from viewer purchases of subscriptions to streamers’ channels and in-app currency (“Bits”) used to cheer or tip streamers. The more time users spend watching streams (often at the expense of sleep, work, or other responsibilities) and the more emotionally invested they become in streamers, the more likely they are to purchase subscriptions or Bits. This creates a perverse incentive for Twitch to encourage addictive usage: users who develop a dependency on Twitch or an obsessive fandom for streamers will spend more money on the platform. Internal industry reports have acknowledged that the “rapid spread” of video game addiction is driven by companies implementing “addictive features and technologies” to keep users hooked and spending . Twitch’s conduct falls squarely within this pattern. Twitch’s model thus extracts money from users by inducing them to engage in ever-increasing amounts of stream viewing and participation, even when such engagement is detrimental to their health, productivity, and well-being.


Harmful Effects of Twitch’s Product on Users
Mental and Cognitive Harm to Users. The foreseeable consequence of Twitch’s design and business practices is serious harm to users’ mental, emotional, and cognitive health. Excessive use of interactive, video game-focused streaming platforms like Twitch has been linked to a variety of negative outcomes, including addiction-like symptoms, depression, anxiety, and impaired cognitive function. Scientific research shows that excessive video gaming and social media use can affect the human brain in ways strikingly similar to addictive substances . Neural imaging studies have found that the brain’s reward pathways in heavy video game users are activated in the same manner as those of drug addicts, and that structural changes (such as heightened sensitivity in the amygdala-striatal system) occur in those with gaming addictions . In other words, prolonged and compulsive engagement with products like Twitch can alter brain chemistry, fostering dependence and tolerance much like a narcotic would. Recent neurological research confirms significant similarities in the brains of people with video game/internet addiction and those with substance use disorders .


Analogy to Addictive Substances. The harm caused by Twitch’s product is analogous to the effects of addictive drugs or gambling. Users experience dopamine reward cycles while watching streams, especially interactive streams where they can participate via chat or receive acknowledgment from streamers. Over time, they can develop an inability to reduce or control their Twitch usage despite negative consequences – a hallmark of addiction. Users (especially young users) may forego sleep, education, work obligations, and face deterioration in real-life relationships as a direct result of compulsive Twitch use. These behaviors mirror the diagnostic criteria for “Internet Gaming Disorder” and “gaming disorder” recognized by WHO and other health authorities . In short, Twitch’s platform, as designed and operated, functions as an addictive product in the same vein as a harmful drug: it provides short-term pleasure or escape, leads to dependency, and inflicts long-term damage on users’ lives.


Lack of Warnings or Safeguards. Despite the known risks of excessive gaming and streaming consumption, Twitch provides no adequate warnings to users about the potential for addiction or harm. There are no prominent disclosures that using Twitch for prolonged periods could cause mental health issues, nor does Twitch meaningfully educate users or parents about warning signs of problematic use. On the contrary, Twitch often celebrates extreme usage. For instance, Twitch has in the past publicized extremely long continuous “subathon” streams (some lasting days or even weeks) as user achievements, implicitly encouraging others to attempt similar feats. Twitch’s Community Guidelines ostensibly prohibit self-harm, but Twitch does not enforce any effective limits on how long streamers can broadcast or how long users can continuously watch. This lack of safeguards or warnings renders the product unreasonably dangerous. Had Plaintiff and other users been informed of the true risks of excessive Twitch use, they could have taken steps to moderate their behavior or avoid the platform; instead, they were lulled into a false sense of safety by Twitch’s silence.


Extreme Cases – Example of Physical Harm. The dangerous nature of Twitch’s product is exemplified by extreme incidents in the Twitch community. In February 2017, a Twitch streamer died after attempting a 24-hour marathon streaming session without rest . This tragedy drew attention to the toll of sleep deprivation and constant engagement that Twitch culture can foster. While Twitch afterward discussed healthy streaming practices, it took no systemic action to curb marathon streams or warn users of the life-threatening risks of such behavior. Other streamers have attempted extremely unsafe challenges (such as staying awake for days) in pursuit of records or viewer milestones, sometimes with Twitch moderators and staff aware. These incidents underscore that Twitch’s platform, as designed, encourages users to push past normal human limits, creating foreseeable risks of both psychological and physical injury.


Targeted Harassment and Stalking of Plaintiff
Harassment by a User Gang. In addition to the general harms of addiction, Plaintiff Bo Shang suffered a sustained campaign of stalking and harassment by a group of Twitch users over a period of approximately seven years (2016–2023). This gang of Twitch users targeted Plaintiff due to his public criticism of Twitch’s platform and practices. In retaliation for Plaintiff speaking out about Twitch (both on and off the platform), these individuals coordinated to harass Plaintiff across multiple channels. The harassment included, but was not limited to: persistent threatening messages via Twitch’s chat and whisper (private message) functions, dissemination of Plaintiff’s personal information (doxing) on Twitch-related forums, encouraging other viewers to mock and attack Plaintiff during live streams, and even following Plaintiff to other social media platforms to continue the abuse. On several occasions, members of this group explicitly threatened Plaintiff with physical harm and incited others to do the same.


Twitch’s Knowledge and Inaction. Twitch was aware, or should have been aware, of the ongoing harassment against Plaintiff and failed to take reasonable steps to stop it. Plaintiff repeatedly reported the harassing users to Twitch via the platform’s reporting tools and by direct contact with Twitch’s support and moderation team. Plaintiff provided evidence of clear violations of Twitch’s Terms of Service and Community Guidelines (which prohibit stalking, harassment, and threats). Despite these reports, Twitch did not permanently ban the majority of the harassers. Some harassing accounts were temporarily suspended, only to return under new accounts or be reinstated after short bans. Twitch’s lax enforcement and failure to implement effective anti-harassment measures allowed the abuse to fester and escalate. On information and belief, Twitch’s algorithms may have even amplified confrontations involving Plaintiff (for example, by promoting streams where the harassment took place, due to high engagement in chat), thus fueling further attacks. Twitch’s platform design — which allows virtually anonymous accounts, permits instant creation of new accounts after bans, and lacks robust proactive moderation — provided the tools and opportunity for this gang of users to relentlessly terrorize Plaintiff.


Severe Emotional Distress and Other Injuries. The seven-year harassment campaign had a devastating effect on Plaintiff’s mental health and sense of personal safety. Plaintiff has endured constant anxiety, fear for his safety, insomnia, and depression as a result of being under siege by Twitch-facilitated abuse. The harassment often referenced Plaintiff’s private life, indicating that harassers were tracking him beyond Twitch, causing Plaintiff to fear stalking and potential real-world attacks. Indeed, on at least one occasion, an associate of the online harassers confronted Plaintiff in person at a gaming convention, shouting a known Twitch-related slur and further intimidating Plaintiff. Plaintiff has sought psychological therapy and counseling to cope with the trauma, and was diagnosed with symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to the prolonged harassment. Twitch’s role in enabling this harm is direct and significant: but for Twitch’s negligent and reckless operation of its platform (failing to enact reasonable safety features or enforce its anti-harassment policies), Plaintiff would not have been exposed to this level of sustained abuse. In sum, Twitch’s product was not just addictive; it also became a vehicle for targeted psychological torment against Plaintiff.


Twitch’s Business Interests Over Safety. Twitch had the capability to implement stronger measures to protect users like Plaintiff from harassment (such as stricter account verification to prevent ban evasion, better content moderation, and dedicated safety staff to handle stalking reports). However, Twitch historically has been reluctant to aggressively police user behavior when doing so might reduce user activity or growth. For example, Twitch executives have acknowledged that stricter moderation can drive away users, impacting the platform’s metrics. Thus, Twitch, in pursuit of profit and user engagement, effectively sacrificed user safety. In Plaintiff’s case, Twitch put its desire to maintain active user counts (even counting harassers) and controversial “drama” content above the well-being of a user who was being victimized. This deliberate indifference is part of Twitch’s broader pattern of prioritizing business objectives over health and safety, and it contributed to the extreme emotional distress Plaintiff suffered.


Section 230 Immunity Does Not Apply
Recent Federal Court Ruling (Shang v. Twitch). Plaintiff Bo Shang has actively sought legal redress for the harms caused by Twitch. In a related federal case, Shang v. Twitch Interactive, Inc., et al., No. 3:24-cv-06664-JSC (N.D. Cal.), Twitch attempted to dismiss Plaintiff’s claims by asserting immunity under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (47 U.S.C. § 230). Section 230 generally shields online service providers from liability for content published by third parties. However, on January 9, 2025, Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued an order ruling that Twitch does not qualify for Section 230 immunity with respect to Plaintiff’s claims. The Court determined that Plaintiff’s lawsuit seeks to hold Twitch liable for Twitch’s own conduct and product features – not for simply hosting someone else’s speech. Specifically, Plaintiff’s claims are premised on the design and operation of the Twitch platform (an allegedly defective product and negligent service), and on Twitch’s own failure to act to protect Plaintiff, rather than treating Twitch as the “publisher or speaker” of the harassing user content. Because the duty at issue (providing a safe product and environment) is independent of any editorial publishing role, Section 230 does not bar Plaintiff’s claims . In reaching this conclusion, the Court’s reasoning aligns with other recent decisions (such as Lemmon v. Snap, Inc., 995 F.3d 1085 (9th Cir. 2021)) confirming that internet platforms can be held liable for their product design choices when those choices cause harm separate from third-party content .


No Preemption of Plaintiff’s Claims. Accordingly, it is established (for purposes of this case) that Section 230 immunity does not apply to shield Twitch from liability. Twitch will not be permitted to escape accountability by blaming only the users or claiming it was a passive publisher. Rather, Twitch is being sued here for its own acts and omissions: designing and distributing a dangerously addictive product, fostering harmful content, and failing to protect its users from known dangers. These claims sound in traditional product liability and tort law, and impose duties that exist independently of any duty to monitor or remove content. Plaintiff therefore properly brings the following causes of action under California law to seek redress for the substantial injuries Twitch has caused.


First Cause of Action: Strict Product Liability (Defective and Unreasonably Dangerous Product)
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.


Product in Question. The Twitch platform – including its software, algorithms, user interface, and overall system – is a product that was designed, manufactured, and put into the stream of commerce by Defendant Twitch. Although Twitch’s service is delivered digitally, it is a mass-produced product used by millions of consumers in a uniform way (through the Twitch app/website). Twitch encourages consumers to download, install, and use its platform as one would use any other consumer product for entertainment. Defendant, by operating and distributing Twitch to the public, is in the business of selling or otherwise placing this product into commerce for profit.


Use in Intended and Foreseeable Manner. Plaintiff and other users used the Twitch product in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner. Specifically, Plaintiff used Twitch to watch video game streams, engage in chat, and participate in the Twitch community – exactly the purposes for which the product is marketed. It was foreseeable (indeed, intended by Defendant) that users like Plaintiff would spend significant time on the platform, interact with other users, and rely on Twitch’s design to guide their usage patterns. Plaintiff’s injuries (addiction, mental health decline, and exposure to harassment) occurred while using Twitch in a normal, foreseeable way (frequent viewing and community interaction), not through any aberrant misuse.


Defective Design. Twitch’s product was and is defective in design, rendering it unreasonably dangerous to users. Under California law, a product is defective in design if it fails to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner, or if the risks of the design outweigh its benefits . Twitch’s platform meets both tests:


Consumer Expectations: Ordinary consumers of social media and gaming content would not expect that using Twitch would lead to serious addiction, psychological disorder, or being subjected to relentless harassment without recourse. An average user would expect an entertainment product to be reasonably safe – certainly not to cause lasting mental harm or to facilitate seven-year-long stalking campaigns. Twitch’s product failed to perform safely as any ordinary consumer would expect; instead, it exposed users to extreme dangers (addiction, mental illness, harassment) that far exceed the norms for similar products.


Risk-Benefit: The risks inherent in Twitch’s design far outweigh any purported benefits. Twitch’s design includes features that maximize user engagement (and thereby Twitch’s profits) at the direct cost of user health and safety – for example, endless auto-play streams, addictive reward systems, and insufficient moderation tools. The benefit of these design choices (increased user activity, entertainment value) is minor compared to the grave risks: users developing clinical gaming disorder, suffering cognitive impairment, or experiencing severe harassment trauma. Feasible alternative designs could have achieved Twitch’s core purpose (live video sharing) without these extreme harms – for instance, implementing optional time limits, usage reminders/warnings, robust content moderation, and better safety controls. Defendant either ignored or rejected such safer alternative designs. A reasonable manufacturer in Twitch’s position would not have placed this product on the market without fixing or warning of these dangers.


Failure to Warn. In addition or in the alternative, Twitch’s product was defective due to inadequate warnings and instructions. The product had known (or knowable in light of scientific and medical knowledge) dangers – addiction and mental health risks akin to gambling or substance abuse, and the risk of severe harassment – that ordinary consumers would not recognize. Defendant failed to provide warnings or instructions that a reasonably prudent manufacturer/distributor would have provided about these dangers. No warnings alerted Plaintiff to limit his usage or be mindful of psychological effects; no guidance was given on how to use Twitch safely without fostering addiction (contrast, for example, to alcohol products that advise “drink responsibly” or casinos that provide problem-gambling hotlines – Twitch provided nothing). Likewise, Twitch provided no adequate mechanism or instruction for vulnerable users to protect themselves from harassment (e.g. no proactive warnings like “report harassment to authorities, here’s how to stay safe online”). The lack of warnings made the product more dangerous than it would be with proper warnings, and this defect was a substantial factor in Plaintiff’s harm. Had clear warnings or safety instructions been provided, Plaintiff and reasonable consumers would have heeded them – for instance, by limiting daily Twitch use, seeking help at signs of addiction, or avoiding engagement with toxic users – thereby avoiding or mitigating injury.


Causation. The defective design and lack of warnings of Twitch’s platform were a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s injuries. Plaintiff became addicted to Twitch and suffered cognitive and psychological harm because the platform was engineered to be addictive and provided no warning – a safer design (or a warning to moderate use) likely would have prevented such outcome. Furthermore, the harassment Plaintiff endured was facilitated and magnified by Twitch’s defective design: Twitch’s platform enabled anonymous, persistent harassment (a design flaw), and failed to warn or shield users from such abuse. If Twitch had implemented a safer design (for example, effective anti-harassment features or monitoring), the severity and duration of the harassment would have been greatly reduced or eliminated. In sum, Plaintiff’s damages – including mental anguish, emotional distress, lost time, and treatment costs – were directly and proximately caused by the defective and unsafe condition of Twitch’s product.


Strict Liability of Defendant. Under California’s strict product liability doctrine, Defendant Twitch is strictly liable for the injuries caused by its defective product, regardless of whether Defendant acted negligently. Twitch is the developer and distributor of the platform and thus a party in the chain of commerce. Plaintiff’s harm occurred while using the product as intended, making Twitch responsible for the consequences. No substantial change in the product occurred after it left Defendant’s control; the product was in essentially the same condition (in terms of its harmful design) at the time of Plaintiff’s injuries as when distributed. Additionally, Plaintiff did not misuse the product in an unforeseeable way – any minor misuse (if at all) was foreseeable and not the sole cause of harm. Therefore, Defendant is liable to Plaintiff for the injuries resulting from the product’s defective design and inadequate warnings.


Damages. As a direct and legal result of the defective and unreasonably dangerous condition of Twitch’s product, Plaintiff has suffered significant damages, including but not limited to: severe emotional distress, mental pain and suffering, disruption of his life, medical and therapy expenses related to treating addiction and trauma, and other compensatory damages according to proof at trial. Plaintiff also faces a continuing risk of future harm and expenses due to the long-term effects of the injuries.


Prayer for Relief on First Cause of Action. WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendant on this cause of action for all compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, for punitive damages as allowed by law, for injunctive relief to abate the ongoing public hazards of the product, and for such other relief as the Court deems just and proper (as detailed in the Prayer for Relief below).


Second Cause of Action: Negligence
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.


Duty of Care. Defendant Twitch owed Plaintiff (and all its users) a duty to exercise reasonable care in the design, development, maintenance, and operation of its platform. As the provider of a product used by millions, Twitch had a duty to avoid causing foreseeable harm to users. This duty includes, inter alia: a duty to design the platform in a reasonably safe manner (avoiding unnecessary risk of addiction or injury); a duty to implement reasonable safeguards to protect users from known dangers (such as harassment or exploitation by other users); and a duty to warn or instruct users about inherent risks of the platform that would not be obvious to an ordinary consumer. Additionally, once Twitch undertook to provide content moderation and community guidelines, it assumed a duty to carry out those undertakings with due care, so as not to increase the risk of harm to users like Plaintiff.


Breach of Duty – Negligent Design and Operation. Twitch breached its duties of care through multiple acts and omissions, including but not limited to the following:


a. Negligent Product Design: Twitch negligently designed its platform to maximize user engagement without regard to user safety. A reasonably careful company in Twitch’s position would have designed the product with protective features (such as optional limits on continuous use, warnings after excessive streaming hours, or less addictive interface choices) to mitigate addiction risks. Twitch failed to do so, instead employing exploitative design that it knew or should have known would likely cause users to become addicted or suffer mental health harms. This design fell below the standard of care, as an ordinary prudent designer would not create a platform that effectively preys on psychological vulnerabilities of users (especially minors or susceptible individuals) without safeguards.
b. Negligent Failure to Warn/Inform: Twitch knew or should have known that its platform could cause harm (addiction, etc.), yet negligently failed to provide adequate warnings or educational information. A reasonable company would have informed users, through on-screen messages or published guidelines, about the importance of moderation and the signs of problematic use. Twitch’s silence on these critical issues constitutes a breach of its duty to warn. Likewise, Twitch provided insufficient warning or tools regarding harassment – for example, failing to adequately warn users about the potential for stalking on the platform or to advise on steps to take if targeted. This lack of warning left users like Plaintiff unaware of the full danger, which is a breach of duty.
c. Negligent Content Moderation and Enforcement: Twitch breached its duty by negligently failing to enforce its own anti-harassment policies and to intervene to protect Plaintiff once it knew he was being harassed. After Plaintiff’s reports, a reasonable platform operator would have taken prompt and decisive action (e.g., permanently banning the offending users, monitoring Plaintiff’s channel for further harassment, cooperating with law enforcement if needed). Twitch’s minimal or delayed response was a breach of the duty to act with ordinary care to avoid exacerbating harm. Twitch’s negligent supervision of its platform allowed known bad actors to continue abusing Plaintiff – an outcome that due care in operations would have prevented.
d. Negligent Retention of Harmful Features: Twitch was on notice from public incidents (like streamer health crises, user complaints about addiction, etc.) that certain features were harmful. For instance, Twitch knew prolonged streaming without breaks was dangerous after widely reported incidents. Yet, Twitch negligently retained features that encourage such behavior (subathon mechanics, lack of enforced breaks) and even now has no effective health notifications. Similarly, Twitch knew automated raids and unfiltered chat could facilitate mass harassment (“hate raids” have been a documented problem on Twitch), yet failed to implement sufficient countermeasures in a timely manner. Each of these omissions reflects a breach of Twitch’s duty to continuously evaluate and improve the safety of its platform.
Foreseeability of Harm. The harms that befell Plaintiff were entirely foreseeable to Twitch. It was well-documented in the tech and psychology communities that social/video game platforms can lead to addiction and that toxic online harassment causes real damage. Twitch’s own experiences (e.g., community outcry over “hate raids” and health issues) made clear that users like Plaintiff could be seriously harmed if Twitch did not exercise care. Thus, Twitch knew or should have known that failing to design safely, failing to warn, and failing to moderate would likely result in injuries to its users. The probability and severity of harm (addiction, psychological trauma) were high, whereas the burden on Twitch to mitigate these risks (via better design or policies) was relatively low – making Twitch’s inaction negligent under established principles of reasonable care.


Causation. Twitch’s breaches of duty were the actual and proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. But for Twitch’s negligence, Plaintiff would not have suffered the extent of addiction and emotional harm that he did. In particular:


Had Twitch designed its platform with reasonable care for user health (for example, including features to discourage excessive continuous use, or content algorithms that don’t exploit addictive tendencies), Plaintiff likely would not have become as addicted or spent such unhealthy amounts of time on Twitch. Twitch’s negligence in design directly led to Plaintiff’s uncontrolled usage and resultant cognitive decline and distress.


Had Twitch provided proper warnings about the risks of overuse and harassment, Plaintiff would have been aware of the dangers and could have limited his Twitch exposure or taken steps to protect himself. The absence of warning meant Plaintiff walked unknowingly into harm’s way.


Had Twitch responded adequately to the harassment (for example, banning the harassers promptly and using technological measures to prevent their return), the seven-year campaign of abuse would have been cut short. Twitch’s negligent lack of intervention allowed the harassment (and Plaintiff’s resultant trauma) to continue unabated. It is reasonably probable that, with proper moderation, Plaintiff might have experienced only isolated incidents rather than a prolonged siege.


Overall, Twitch’s acts and omissions set in motion and/or failed to halt the chain of events that caused Plaintiff’s injuries. The injuries were not due to an unrelated superseding cause; rather, they flowed naturally from Twitch’s negligent operation of an addictive, under-regulated platform.


Damages. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s negligence, Plaintiff sustained the damages described above (in paragraphs 15 and 16, among others). These include severe emotional distress, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, costs for psychological treatment and counseling, and other economic and non-economic losses according to proof. Plaintiff’s injuries are ongoing – he continues to suffer effects from the past harm and may require future medical or therapeutic care.


Comparative Fault and Plaintiff’s Conduct. Plaintiff was at all times using Twitch in a normal and intended manner. Any suggestion that Plaintiff should have simply stopped using Twitch or avoided the harassment does not absolve Defendant: given the addictive design, Plaintiff’s continued use was itself a result of Twitch’s negligence. Furthermore, once targeted by harassment, a victim like Plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to prevent the harm on his own (short of abandoning the platform entirely, which, even if done, would not stop determined stalkers from finding him elsewhere). Nevertheless, Plaintiff exercised reasonable care for his own safety under the circumstances; he made numerous reports and attempted to seek help. The comparative fault, if any, of Plaintiff is minimal in relation to Defendant’s gross negligence, and in no way cuts off Defendant’s liability.


Prayer for Relief on Second Cause of Action. WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendant for compensatory damages in an amount to be determined, including costs of medical/therapeutic care and compensation for emotional distress, for punitive damages to the extent Defendant’s conduct reflects malice or conscious disregard for safety, for appropriate injunctive relief to require Defendant to remedy the negligent conditions of its platform, and for such further relief as the Court deems just (as set forth in the Prayer for Relief below).


Third Cause of Action: Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.


Extreme and Outrageous Conduct by Defendant. Defendant Twitch, through its acts and omissions described, engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct that caused Plaintiff severe emotional distress. “Extreme and outrageous conduct” is behavior that is so atrocious and beyond the bounds of decency that it is utterly intolerable in a civilized community. Twitch’s conduct meets this standard in multiple respects:


Deliberate Exploitation of Addiction: It is outrageous for a company to knowingly design and operate a product that exploits users’ psychological vulnerabilities (including minors and vulnerable individuals) in order to reap profit, while publicly denying or downplaying the harm. Twitch’s conscious decision to put its users’ mental health at risk – effectively hooking them on a potentially harmful product – for corporate gain is despicable and highly culpable conduct.


Conscious Disregard of Harassment of Plaintiff: Despite knowing that Plaintiff was being brutally harassed and stalked via its platform, Twitch willfully turned a blind eye, allowing the abuse to continue. Over seven years, Twitch never took effective action, essentially condoning the torment by inaction. This deliberate indifference to a user’s life-threatening harassment (including credible threats of violence from the harassers) is egregious. A reasonable observer would find it outrageous that a company would let one of its customers be terrorized in this manner when it had the power to stop it.


Profit Over Safety Motive: The outrageousness is amplified by the fact that Twitch’s motive in each instance was corporate profit – i.e., to avoid losing users or revenue. Twitch chose to keep known abusers on the platform because banning them might shrink viewership metrics; Twitch chose not to implement safety features because they might reduce engagement time. Prioritizing money over a person’s safety and mental well-being, repeatedly over years, transcends all bounds of decency.


Pattern and Policy: Twitch’s actions were not isolated accidents; they reflect a pattern and corporate policy. The cumulative effect of Twitch’s course of conduct toward Plaintiff and similarly situated users demonstrates a level of moral culpability that society should not tolerate.


Intent or Reckless Disregard. Defendant acted with the requisite intent to cause emotional distress, or at minimum with reckless disregard of the near certainty that emotional distress would result. Twitch’s key decision-makers knew that Plaintiff (and others) would suffer severe distress as a result of their conduct:


Twitch was repeatedly alerted to Plaintiff’s harrowing situation. By failing to act, Twitch either intended Plaintiff to continue suffering (if, for example, Twitch harbored animus toward Plaintiff for criticizing the platform) or, at best, recklessly refused to care about the consequences. Even if Twitch’s primary intention was financial rather than to hurt Plaintiff, the law equates reckless indifference to the likelihood of severe distress with the intent requirement for IIED. Twitch had been made well aware that its actions/inactions were causing Plaintiff intense anguish (through Plaintiff’s reports and pleas), yet it persisted.


With regard to the addictive design, Twitch’s conduct was intentional in the sense that it purposefully designed the platform to entrap users in a cycle of excessive use, knowing full well (from internal data or external research) that this could lead to psychological harm. At the very least, Twitch was substantially certain that some users would develop disordered behavior and emotional distress, yet proceeded in conscious disregard of that risk.


In summary, Defendant’s state of mind was willful and wanton: Twitch either wanted the harm to occur or didn’t care if it did.
Severe Emotional Distress. As described, Plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress as a result of Twitch’s outrageous conduct. Plaintiff’s distress was not trivial or transitory; it is profound, long-lasting, and has significantly impaired his daily functioning. Plaintiff has experienced emotional agony manifesting as anxiety attacks, chronic depression, paranoia regarding online interactions, and loss of ability to trust others. The fear instilled by the harassment (and Twitch’s non-response) is so severe that Plaintiff for a time feared leaving his home and interacting with anyone online, leading to social isolation. The distress also somatically manifested in insomnia, weight fluctuations, and other stress-related health issues. Plaintiff’s severe emotional distress was a reasonable and expected reaction to Defendant’s conduct – any reasonable person subjected to the same treatment would likely suffer extreme distress.


Causation (IIED). Defendant’s outrageous conduct was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff’s severe emotional distress. There is a direct causal link: Twitch’s refusal to stop the harassment and its enabling of the harassers caused Plaintiff to live in constant fear and mental torture, which is the essence of his emotional distress. Similarly, Twitch’s betrayal of trust (in creating an addictive, harmful environment) deeply affected Plaintiff’s mental state, making him feel victimized by a system much larger than himself. Plaintiff’s distress did not arise from other independent sources; it was specifically induced by the pattern of abuse and negligence orchestrated by Twitch’s platform and policies.


No Privilege or Justification. Defendant’s conduct had no legal or social justification. Any claim that Twitch was merely exercising free speech or business judgment is untenable given the scope of harm. The law does not protect (or “privilege”) the kind of willfully injurious behavior Twitch engaged in. Thus, all elements of IIED are satisfied.


Damages (IIED). By virtue of Defendant’s intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress, Plaintiff is entitled to damages for the severe emotional and psychological harm endured. This includes compensation for pain and suffering, medical/therapy expenses for treating emotional injury, and all other actual damages flowing from the distress. Additionally, because Defendant’s actions were malicious, oppressive, and in conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, Plaintiff seeks an award of punitive damages to punish Defendant and deter similar outrageous conduct in the future.


Prayer for Relief on Third Cause of Action. WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendant for general damages (for emotional distress) according to proof, for punitive and exemplary damages in an amount sufficient to punish and make an example of Defendant, for appropriate injunctive relief to prevent Defendant from continuing the conduct towards others, and for such further relief as the Court deems just (as detailed below).


Fourth Cause of Action: Unfair Business Practices (Cal. Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq.)
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.


Unlawful, Unfair, or Fraudulent Acts. Defendant Twitch has engaged in unlawful, unfair, and fraudulent business acts and practices, in violation of California Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq. (the Unfair Competition Law or “UCL”). The UCL defines “unfair competition” to include “any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice” . In this case, Twitch’s conduct violates all three prongs:


Unlawful Prong: Twitch’s acts and practices as described violate numerous laws and regulations, including the California tort laws against product defects, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (as alleged in the preceding causes of action). Each of those violations of law also constitutes a predicate “unlawful” act under §17200. By providing an unsafe product and violating its duty of care and other legal obligations, Twitch has engaged in unlawful business practices.


Unfair Prong: Independently, Twitch’s conduct is “unfair” within the meaning of §17200 because it offends established public policy and/or is immoral, unethical, oppressive, and substantially injurious to consumers. The public policy in California favors protecting consumers from dangerous products and deceptive, harmful practices. Twitch’s extractive business model (profiting from addictive usage and harassment) contravenes the spirit and policy of numerous laws aimed at consumer protection and mental health (for instance, policies underlying consumer safety statutes and anti-bullying laws). The harm to consumers (addiction, mental illness, harassment trauma) greatly outweighs any utility of Twitch’s conduct. There is no societal benefit to encouraging behavioral addiction or tolerating stalking; Twitch’s only benefit is increased profit, which is outweighed by the significant injury to the public. Further, Twitch’s practices force its users to either suffer injury or give up participating in a major platform, an inequitable choice. Thus, Twitch’s conduct is unfair and should be enjoined under the UCL.


Fraudulent Prong: Twitch’s acts and omissions were also “fraudulent” in the sense that they were likely to deceive the public. Twitch holds itself out as a fun, community-oriented platform and implies by its public messaging that it is safe and responsibly run. In reality, Twitch conceals the dark side of its platform. Reasonable consumers are misled into believing Twitch is benign entertainment, when in fact Twitch knowingly fosters addiction and harassment. Twitch’s failure to disclose material information – such as the true risks of excessive use or the extent of unchecked harassment – is a deceptive practice. Users like Plaintiff were deceived about the product’s safety. Had the truth been known, consumers might have made different choices (for example, using Twitch less, or demanding better protections, or avoiding it altogether). Twitch’s marketing and silence on crucial issues thus constitute fraudulent business practices under the UCL.


Ongoing Conduct – Public Interest. Twitch’s unfair business practices are ongoing and present a continuing threat to members of the public. Unless enjoined by this Court, Twitch will continue to employ the same tactics and practices, causing new or additional users to suffer similar harm. Plaintiff brings this claim not only for his own benefit but also on behalf of the general public, seeking injunctive relief to protect others from the misconduct. Plaintiff has standing to pursue this claim because he has lost money or property (in the form of monetary expenditures on Twitch and related costs, as well as the loss of valuable time and opportunities) as a result of Twitch’s practices, and he has personally suffered injury in fact.


Relief Sought under UCL. Pursuant to Business & Professions Code § 17203, Plaintiff seeks equitable relief in the form of an injunction to prevent continued unfair competition by Defendant. In particular, Plaintiff seeks an order permanently enjoining Twitch from continuing to operate in the unlawful and harmful manner described. This may include, at the Court’s discretion: requiring Twitch to fundamentally redesign its platform to eliminate the addictive and harmful features, mandating robust safety and moderation measures, requiring clear warnings to users about risks, and/or if necessary, ceasing certain operations until compliance is ensured. Plaintiff also seeks any other equitable relief appropriate under the UCL, including restitution or disgorgement of ill-gotten gains to the extent Plaintiff and others paid money into Twitch under unfair and deceptive circumstances. (Plaintiff notes that restitution may be minimal in this case relative to the injury, but injunctive relief is paramount.)


No Adequate Remedy at Law. Legal damages alone are insufficient to protect the public from Twitch’s practices, thus equitable relief is justified. The injunctive relief sought will serve the public interest by stopping practices that significantly harm public health and safety. Plaintiff, having been a victim of these practices, brings this cause of action to ensure Defendant is held accountable not just in damages to him, but in making changes for the future.


Prayer for Relief on Fourth Cause of Action. WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment under the UCL for a court order enjoining Defendant from engaging in the aforementioned unfair business acts and practices, for restitution of any money or property acquired by Defendant through such practices (in an amount to be proven), for costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees as allowed by law (e.g., under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1021.5, if applicable), and for any other relief the Court deems just and proper to prevent and remedy the unfair competition.


Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Bo Shang prays that judgment be entered in his favor and against Defendant Twitch Interactive, Inc., as follows:
1. Compensatory Damages: For an award of general and special damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including but not limited to compensation for Plaintiff’s pain, suffering, emotional distress, medical and therapy expenses, lost time/productivity, and other pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses resulting from Defendant’s conduct.
2. Restitution/Disgorgement: For restitutionary disgorgement of all monies Defendant obtained from Plaintiff (and, as appropriate, from similarly situated consumers) through its unlawful or unfair practices, as permitted by law, including refund of any money spent by Plaintiff on the Twitch platform that was induced or sustained by Defendant’s misconduct.
3. Punitive Damages: For an award of punitive and exemplary damages in an amount sufficient to punish Defendant for its willful, malicious, and egregious conduct and to deter such conduct in the future (with respect to the causes of action where punitive damages are legally available, i.e., negligence and IIED, and as allowed under product liability for wanton disregard of safety).
4. Injunctive Relief: For a permanent injunction ordering Defendant to cease its unlawful, unfair, and harmful practices. Plaintiff specifically seeks injunctive relief requiring Twitch to cease operations that continue to harm users until and unless Twitch complies with court-ordered safety standards. This may include an injunction to temporarily shut down or substantially restrict the Twitch platform unless and until Defendant implements adequate safeguards against addiction and harassment. In the alternative or additionally, an injunction requiring Defendant to make specific changes to the platform (such as implementing warning disclosures, time limits, enhanced moderation and user safety tools, removal of particularly exploitative features, etc.), under Court supervision, to ensure the product is no longer unreasonably dangerous.
5. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs: For an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of suit incurred herein to the extent permitted by law (for example, under the UCL, Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5 (private attorney general doctrine), or any other applicable provision), or, if Plaintiff is pro se, for allowable court costs and expenses.
6. Prejudgment Interest: For an award of pre-judgment and post-judgment interest as allowed by law on all applicable damages.
7. Such Other Relief as the Court Deems Just: For such other and further relief as this Court may deem just, proper, and equitable, including any and all relief necessary to fairly compensate Plaintiff and to prevent Defendant from continuing to inflict harm.
DATED: May 4, 2025.  Respectfully submitted,
[Plaintiff Bo Shang, Pro Se] (or Plaintiff’s counsel)
