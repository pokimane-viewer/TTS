Defendants. | JURY TRIAL DEMANDED

⸻

Plaintiff Bo Shang, by and through undersigned counsel, alleges the following against Defendants Amazon.com, Inc. and Twitch Interactive, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”):

I. PARTIES
	1.	Plaintiff. Plaintiff Bo Shang is an individual residing in Massachusetts (temporarily in Washington for this action) and the registrant of the domain name pdfsage.org (“the Domain”). Plaintiff is the founder of the PDFSage platform and has invested substantial time and resources developing the website and related business under the Domain. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was the lawful holder of the Domain’s registration.
	2.	Defendant Amazon.com, Inc. Defendant Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”) is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Seattle, Washington. Amazon transacts business in King County, Washington. Amazon, through its Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) division, operates Amazon Route 53, an internet domain name registration service that is an ICANN-accredited domain registrar. Amazon is responsible for the actions of AWS and Route 53 with respect to domain name registrations.
	3.	Defendant Twitch Interactive, Inc. Defendant Twitch Interactive, Inc. (“Twitch”) is a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amazon with headquarters in San Francisco, California and significant offices in Seattle, Washington. Twitch conducts business in King County and, on information and belief, participates in or influences Amazon’s online services, including domain administration and enforcement policies. Twitch is joined as a Defendant due to its role as an Amazon affiliate that may have participated in or benefitted from the wrongful conduct alleged, and to ensure full injunctive relief can be effectively applied to all Amazon-related entities involved in domain management.

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
	4.	Subject Matter Jurisdiction. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action. Plaintiff brings claims under Washington State law, including breach of contract, violation of ICANN domain registrar policies (as incorporated in agreements), the Washington Consumer Protection Act, and conversion, among other theories. The amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional minimum of this Court. This Court has authority to grant the declaratory and injunctive relief requested herein.
	5.	Personal Jurisdiction. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants Amazon and Twitch because both Defendants conduct substantial business in the State of Washington and in King County. Amazon’s principal place of business is in King County, and Twitch maintains offices and operations in King County. The wrongful acts and omissions alleged were carried out, directed, or approved by Defendants from Washington. By operating a domain registrar service and other online services from Washington and engaging in the conduct at issue affecting a Washington-based account, Defendants have purposefully availed themselves of the laws of Washington.
	6.	Venue. Venue is proper in King County under RCW 4.12.020(3) because the Defendants reside and conduct business in King County and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in King County. Amazon’s Route 53 domain registration business is operated in this County, and the injury to Plaintiff’s property (the Domain) was effectuated through Defendants’ actions in King County.

III. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

A. Plaintiff’s Registration of PDFSage.org and Transfer to Amazon Route 53
	7.	Original Registration through Squarespace. On or about December 7, 2020, Plaintiff registered the domain name pdfsage.org through Squarespace Domains LLC (“Squarespace”), an ICANN-accredited domain name registrar. Plaintiff initially paid for a multi-year registration term for pdfsage.org. Squarespace’s records and communications (see Exhibit A, a true copy of a Squarespace email confirmation) show that the Domain was registered to Plaintiff and set to auto-renew annually. By late 2024, the Domain’s registration was in good standing and carried an expiration date of December 7, 2025 (with automatic renewal in place to extend beyond that date). This meant that as of early 2025, Plaintiff had a clear contractual right to use and control the Domain through at least December 7, 2025.
	8.	Auto-Renewal Status. At all times, Plaintiff ensured that auto-renewal was enabled on the Domain registration and that payment information was up to date. Under industry standards and ICANN policy, domain registrants who enable auto-renew and maintain payment are entitled to continuous renewal of their domain names without lapse. Amazon’s own Domain Name Registration Agreement confirms that “Automatic Renewal will be enabled by default” for domain registrations ￼, and it offers auto-renewal precisely “to ensure that you do not experience an interruption in … or loss of a Registered Name” ￼. Consistent with these standards, Plaintiff relied on the auto-renew feature to protect the Domain from accidental expiration.
	9.	Transfer to AWS Route 53. In or about early January 2024, Plaintiff decided to transfer the Domain’s registration from Squarespace to Amazon’s Route 53 domain registration service (operated by AWS). The transfer was initiated and completed through the standard ICANN transfer process. Exhibit B (a true copy of an AWS confirmation email dated January 15, 2024) confirms that the Domain transfer to Amazon’s Route 53 was successful. Upon transfer, Amazon became the registrar of record for pdfsage.org. The Domain’s expiration date remained December 7, 2025 (and, by ICANN rules, should have remained unchanged or extended by one year as a result of the transfer, since .ORG transfers typically add a year of registration). Plaintiff did not disable auto-renewal at any point during or after the transfer; in fact, AWS Route 53’s console showed that the Domain was set to auto-renew under Amazon’s management.
	10.	Registrar Obligations on Transfer. By accepting the transfer, Amazon (through its registrar services) assumed all registrar obligations under the ICANN Registrar Accreditation Agreement (“RAA”) and ICANN consensus policies for the Domain. Amazon’s Route 53 Domain Registration Agreement explicitly states that both AWS and its Registrar partner must comply with all ICANN requirements ￼. These requirements include honoring the existing registration period and auto-renew status of transferred domains, providing expiration notices, and following proper procedures before any deletion. Plaintiff reasonably expected that Amazon, as a large sophisticated registrar, would strictly adhere to such obligations and ensure the Domain remained continuously registered through its expiration date and beyond (subject to renewal).

B. Deletion of the Domain by Amazon Route 53 in April 2025
	11.	Interruption of Domain Service. In April 2025, Plaintiff discovered that the website and email services associated with pdfsage.org had abruptly stopped working. On or about April 10, 2025, Plaintiff noticed that pdfsage.org was no longer resolving to his website. This was alarming and unexpected, given that the Domain was not due to expire until December 2025 and Plaintiff had received no expiration warnings or renewal failure notices.
	12.	AWS Account Inquiry. Plaintiff immediately logged into the AWS Route 53 console to investigate. Shockingly, the Domain pdfsage.org was no longer listed as an active domain in Plaintiff’s AWS account. It appeared as though the Domain registration had vanished. Plaintiff did not receive any prior email or notice from Amazon indicating that the Domain would be or had been deleted. Upon discovering the Domain missing, Plaintiff contacted AWS support for an explanation.
	13.	Amazon’s Deletion of the Domain. AWS support eventually informed Plaintiff (via an email on April 12, 2025 – see Exhibit C) that the Domain registration had been deleted. The support representative indicated, in vague terms, that the Domain was no longer in Plaintiff’s account and had been removed from Amazon’s registrar system. No coherent explanation was given for the deletion. Defendants did not claim non-payment (indeed, none was due, as the Domain was prepaid through 2025). Defendants did not cite any breach of terms by Plaintiff. The only reference was that the Domain might have been subject to some “dispute” or “policy” review. Plaintiff was stunned; he never consented to any deletion, and there was no legitimate basis for Amazon to unilaterally delete a domain that was fully paid-up and not expiring for many months.
	14.	No Expiration or Payment Issue. The deletion of pdfsage.org by Amazon was not the result of any expiration or lapse. At the time of deletion in April 2025, the Domain still had roughly 8 months left before its listed expiration date. AWS’s own policy is to attempt auto-renewal 35 days before expiration ￼, which for a December 7, 2025 expiration would not occur until around November 2, 2025. Thus, in April 2025, the Domain was well within an active registration period, and Amazon should have had no reason even to consider expiration-related deletion. Moreover, Plaintiff’s payment method on file was current, and Amazon never attempted and failed to charge any renewal fee (which was not yet due). Therefore, any suggestion that the Domain was dropped for non-renewal is false. The deletion was premature and unauthorized under any standard domain lifecycle.
	15.	No Notice or Opportunity to Recover. Amazon did not provide Plaintiff with any advance notice that the Domain was at risk of deletion. ICANN’s Expired Registration Recovery Policy (ERRP) requires multiple notices to registrants before a domain expires (including notices 1 month and 1 week before expiration, and a notice after expiration) ￼. Here, where expiration was not even imminent, Amazon nonetheless failed to warn Plaintiff of any issue. Even after deletion, Amazon did not immediately inform Plaintiff of the possibility to recover the Domain. Under ICANN rules, when a domain is deleted by a registrar, it typically enters a 30-day Redemption Grace Period (RGP) during which the original registrant can redeem (restore) the domain by paying a restoration fee ￼. Amazon’s own terms acknowledge this, stating that the Registrar may offer a redemption period post-deletion during which a deleted domain can be restored (for a fee) before it is finally purged ￼. However, Amazon never offered Plaintiff the chance to redeem or restore pdfsage.org during the RGP. By the time Plaintiff learned of the deletion and tried to resolve it, critical days had passed. Amazon’s misconduct thus not only deleted the Domain without cause, but also effectively robbed Plaintiff of the usual last chance to recover his digital property.
	16.	Current Status of the Domain. As a result of Defendants’ actions, the Domain pdfsage.org is no longer under Plaintiff’s control. A WHOIS lookup in late April 2025 showed that the Domain’s registration had been removed from Amazon’s registrar and was in a redemption or pending-delete status. If not restored, the Domain could be re-registered by a third party after the lapse of the redemption and pending deletion periods. The value of the Domain to Plaintiff’s business is immense – it is the linchpin of Plaintiff’s branding and the primary address through which he reaches users and customers. Losing the Domain has already caused severe disruption to Plaintiff’s operations, client communications, and reputation. Moreover, there is a serious risk that a bad actor could seize the Domain once it’s publicly available, further harming Plaintiff and the public (for instance, by hosting malicious content at a domain known to be associated with Plaintiff’s business).
	17.	Plaintiff’s Efforts to Resolve the Issue. Plaintiff has made numerous attempts to resolve this matter without litigation. Plaintiff contacted AWS support multiple times, escalating the issue and requesting immediate restoration of the Domain. Despite providing proof of the prior registration term and auto-renewal status (including forwarding the Squarespace confirmation of the 2025 expiration), Amazon has failed or refused to reinstate the Domain. Amazon’s representatives have given inconsistent responses. In one communication, an AWS support supervisor admitted that the deletion “should not have happened given the auto-renewal setting,” but claimed that nothing could be done because the Domain was already in the deletion pipeline. In another communication, a representative referenced an unspecified “policy dispute” that might have triggered the deletion, but could not cite any specific policy or complainant. To date, Defendants have not provided a satisfactory explanation, have not reversed the deletion, and have not compensated Plaintiff in any way.

C. ICANN Policies and Registrars’ Duties Regarding Domain Expiration, Transfer, and Deletion
	18.	ICANN’s Role and Policies. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) oversees the domain name system and accredits companies like Amazon to act as domain name registrars. As part of accreditation, registrars must adhere to ICANN’s policies and rules, which are designed to protect registrants and ensure fair handling of domain names. These include the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP) and its associated rules, the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA), and consensus policies such as the Expired Registration Recovery Policy (ERRP) and Expired Domain Deletion Policy. Defendants, through operating Route 53, are obligated to follow all such policies. Indeed, Amazon’s own customer agreement emphasizes that AWS and its registrar partners “are required to comply with terms specified by (a) ICANN and (b) the Registry Operator for each specific gTLD” ￼.
	19.	Prohibition on Unilateral Cancellation or Transfer. Under ICANN’s Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy (UDRP), a registrar is not permitted to cancel, suspend, or transfer a domain name without the registrant’s consent or a court order, except in narrowly defined circumstances (such as an adverse UDRP decision after the opportunity for court review) ￼. In other words, absent a legitimate dispute outcome or the registrant’s request, the registrar must maintain the status quo of the domain registration ￼. This rule is fundamental to domain registration agreements and is incorporated by reference into every ICANN domain contract. Defendants violated this core principle by canceling Plaintiff’s domain outright with neither consent nor any court order. No UDRP proceeding was ever decided against the Domain or Plaintiff; thus, Defendants had no authority under ICANN policy to delete the Domain.
	20.	Expiration Timeline and Grace Periods. ICANN’s Expired Registration Recovery Policy (ERRP) and related rules set strict timelines and procedures for handling domain name expirations. Even when a domain does reach its expiration date (which, again, was not the case for pdfsage.org at the time of deletion), the registrar must provide the registrant with advance notice of pending expiration (at 1 month and 1 week before expiration) and a notice of actual expiration ￼. After expiration, registrars typically provide a late renewal grace period (often around 30-45 days) during which the registrant can still renew by paying the regular fee. If the domain is not renewed during that period, the registrar must delete the domain within 45 days after expiration, per ICANN rules ￼. Following deletion, the domain enters the 30-day Redemption Grace Period (RGP) during which the former registrant can redeem it by paying a redemption fee ￼. Only after the RGP (and a short “Pending Delete” period of 5 days) will the domain become available for others to register ￼. These policies ensure that registrants have multiple opportunities to prevent losing their domains due to oversight or error.
	21.	Registrar Duties During Disputes (UDRP). In the event a domain name becomes subject to a UDRP dispute (typically a trademark-based challenge), registrars have special obligations to maintain the domain’s status. Under RAA §3.7.5.7, if a domain that is the subject of a UDRP is deleted or expires during the dispute, the complaining party in the UDRP proceeding has the option to renew or restore the domain name under the same terms as the registrant ￼. This rule is intended to prevent a domain from simply disappearing or falling into third-party hands while a dispute is pending. Additionally, UDRP Rule 8 forbids transferring a domain to another registrar or registrant once a UDRP is filed, ensuring the domain remains locked in place until the dispute is resolved. In short, ICANN expects domains to remain intact and not be arbitrarily removed from the system while rights are being adjudicated. A registrar may temporarily renew a domain (even without the registrant’s explicit consent) if necessary to prevent its deletion in an ongoing dispute or other extenuating circumstances ￼. This underscores that deletion is to be avoided in any questionable situation until due process is observed.
	22.	Application to Defendants’ Conduct. Defendants fell egregiously short of these ICANN mandates. First, no expiration process was followed at all for Plaintiff’s Domain – there were no pre-expiration notices, no opportunity for late renewal, and no adherence to the 45-day post-expiration window, since the Domain hadn’t expired. Amazon’s action was essentially to skip to an improper “deletion” with no due process. Second, if Defendants believed there was any kind of “dispute” or policy concern involving the Domain, they were duty-bound to maintain the Domain (lock it if needed) and seek resolution, not to delete it. Registrars are explicitly forbidden from cancelling a domain without the registrant’s consent prior to resolution of a dispute ￼, yet that is exactly what Amazon did here. Third, by failing to offer Plaintiff the chance to redeem the Domain in the RGP, Defendants violated the spirit and letter of the ICANN restoration policy that aims to protect registrants from accidental loss ￼ ￼.
	23.	Unfair “Buyback” Practices. Some registrars engage in unethical “buyback” or auction practices, where valuable domains that expire are sold off or monetized by the registrar or its partners instead of being easily restored to the original owner. ICANN’s policies seek to curb this by requiring transparent renewal and redemption practices. In this case, Plaintiff fears that Defendants’ deletion of pdfsage.org – a domain with significant value – could be a prelude to such unfair practices. Already, the lack of cooperation in restoring the Domain suggests Defendants may be attempting to hold the Domain hostage for profit or to allow a third-party sale. Any such conduct is strictly against ICANN’s registrant protection principles. Registrars must act in the interests of the registrant when a domain is within its paid term and even when just expired. By treating Plaintiff’s Domain as if it were theirs to delete or dispose of at will, Defendants demonstrated a wanton disregard for the rules that govern them as well as for Plaintiff’s rights.
	24.	Summary of Wrongful Conduct. In summary, Defendants’ deletion of the Domain was a grave breach of their obligations. It violated the contractual promises made to Plaintiff, flouted multiple ICANN regulations (including UDRP and expiration-related rules), and was executed without any notice or recourse. Plaintiff had a reasonable expectation, based on explicit representations and industry norms, that his Domain registration would be honored through its term and renewed absent any failure on his part. Instead, Defendants summarily erased Plaintiff’s valuable property interest. This conduct has caused Plaintiff significant harm, including loss of business, loss of goodwill, expenses in attempting recovery, and severe emotional distress from the threat to his livelihood. Defendants must be held accountable for these actions, and steps must be taken to prevent Amazon (and its affiliates like Twitch) from ever doing this to Plaintiff or any other domain owner again.

IV. CAUSES OF ACTION

Each of the following causes of action is alleged against both Defendants, Amazon and Twitch, jointly and severally.

COUNT I – Breach of Contract
	25.	Contract with Amazon/AWS. Plaintiff and Defendant Amazon (through its AWS Route 53 service) entered into a valid and binding contract for domain name registration services. The contract arose when Plaintiff transferred his domain registration for pdfsage.org to Amazon’s Route 53 registrar in January 2024 and agreed to Amazon’s Domain Name Registration Agreement and related AWS terms. In exchange for Plaintiff’s payment of registration fees and compliance with the service terms, Amazon agreed to provide domain registration services for the Domain through at least December 7, 2025, and thereafter so long as Plaintiff continued to renew. The terms of the contract included Amazon’s obligations under its own Registration Agreement and incorporated ICANN policies, as described above. Plaintiff also maintained a contractual relationship with Squarespace (the original registrar) which was intended to be succeeded by Amazon upon transfer, meaning Amazon was aware (or should have been aware) of the existing registration term and auto-renew status as part of the transfer of the service. Plaintiff fully performed all his obligations under the contract, including payment and adherence to Amazon’s rules.
	26.	Breach by Amazon. Amazon materially breached the contract by deleting (or allowing the deletion of) the Domain well before the end of the paid registration term and by failing to provide domain registration services through the agreed period. Specific breaches include: (a) failing to safeguard the Domain through the expiration date of December 7, 2025; (b) disabling or overriding the auto-renewal feature that was contractually promised to be enabled by default and relied upon by Plaintiff ￼; (c) failing to provide required notices or any warning prior to terminating the Domain registration; (d) deleting the Domain without any valid cause authorized by the agreement (such as registrant’s non-payment or a lawful order); and (e) refusing to restore the Domain after improper deletion. Amazon’s breach is a direct violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicit in every contract, as Amazon’s actions utterly deprived Plaintiff of the benefit of his bargain (continuous domain registration).
	27.	Breach by Twitch (Alter Ego / Agency). On information and belief, Twitch acted in concert with Amazon or as Amazon’s agent in the events leading to the breach. Twitch is closely integrated with Amazon’s online operations and may have been involved in flagging Plaintiff’s Domain or implementing a policy that resulted in the deletion. To the extent Twitch’s conduct contributed to the contractual breach (for example, if Twitch reported the Domain for some alleged violation prompting Amazon to delete it outside of normal procedure), Twitch is liable for inducing or participating in Amazon’s breach. Furthermore, Twitch is an Amazon subsidiary benefitting from Amazon’s contracts; Twitch can be considered an alter ego of Amazon in this context, such that holding only Amazon to account would be insufficient to grant complete relief. Therefore, Twitch is also charged under this Count.
	28.	Damages from Breach. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ breach of contract, Plaintiff has suffered substantial damages. These include, but are not limited to: the loss of the Domain itself (an asset with significant intrinsic and business value), loss of business revenue due to the website’s downtime and loss of user access, damage to Plaintiff’s reputation and customer trust, costs incurred in attempting to recover the Domain (including time spent, technical and legal expenses), and the loss of email service and data tied to the Domain. The value of the Domain “pdfsage.org” to Plaintiff’s enterprise is estimated to exceed $100,000, given the branding, development, and goodwill attached to it. Plaintiff’s damages continue to accrue so long as the Domain remains out of his control. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all actual and consequential damages caused by Defendants’ breach, in an amount to be proven at trial.
	29.	Specific Performance / Restoration (if possible). In addition to monetary damages, Plaintiff seeks, as a contractual remedy, specific performance to the extent possible – namely, an order requiring Amazon to use all means available (through the registry or otherwise) to restore Plaintiff’s registration of pdfsage.org. Contract law recognizes that unique or irreplaceable assets may warrant specific relief. The Domain is unique; mere money cannot fully compensate Plaintiff for its loss. If the Domain is still within any redemption or grace period under Amazon’s control, Amazon should be compelled to facilitate its return to Plaintiff upon his payment of any standard renewal or redemption fee (which Plaintiff stands ready to pay). This remedy is warranted to put Plaintiff in the position he expected under the contract.

COUNT II – Violation of ICANN Policies / Third-Party Beneficiary Breach
	30.	ICANN Policy as Contractual Obligation. ICANN’s rules and policies, including the UDRP and RAA provisions described, form part of the contract between Plaintiff and the registrar. By ICANN mandate, all registrants are third-party beneficiaries of the registrar’s agreement to follow ICANN’s consensus policies. Plaintiff, as a registrant, was therefore an intended beneficiary of Amazon’s obligations to ICANN. Defendants were required (by both contract and by virtue of accreditation) to comply with ICANN policies for the benefit of registrants like Plaintiff ￼. Any violation of those policies that harms a registrant is effectively a breach of the duty owed to that registrant.
	31.	Specific ICANN Rules Violated. Defendants violated multiple ICANN policies, including but not limited to: (a) UDRP Rule/Policy ¶4 and ¶8 (and analogous RAA provisions) by cancelling Plaintiff’s domain name without a UDRP decision or court order, and without Plaintiff’s consent ￼; (b) RAA §3.7.5.7 by failing to honor the requirement that if a domain in dispute is deleted or expires, the complainant (if any) be given the chance to renew ￼ – here Amazon’s deletion prevented any orderly dispute resolution process; (c) the Expired Registration Recovery Policy (ERRP) by not providing required expiration notifications and not affording Plaintiff the contractually required grace periods ￼ ￼; and (d) the Redemption Grace Period practice by failing to allow or inform Plaintiff of the 30-day post-deletion redemption opportunity ￼. Each of these failures is a violation of the standards that ICANN has put in place to protect consumers.
	32.	Unfair Deletion Protocol. In addition, Defendants violated the spirit and letter of ICANN’s Deletion Policy. Under that policy, “a domain name must be deleted within 45 days of either the registrar or the registrant terminating a registration agreement” ￼, and not earlier. By deleting the Domain in April 2025, Amazon effectively terminated the registration unilaterally far more than 45 days before the natural end of the term (which would be December 7, 2025). There was no registrant request to terminate; to the contrary, Plaintiff wanted to keep the Domain. Thus, Amazon’s timing flouted ICANN’s required deletion protocols. Moreover, Amazon’s internal policy acknowledges it may renew a domain in certain extenuating circumstances to prevent deletion ￼, yet Amazon ignored an obvious extenuating circumstance here – namely, that the Domain was of high importance and its deletion was contested by Plaintiff immediately. Such disregard for ICANN-approved exceptions underscores Defendants’ willful non-compliance.
	33.	Enforcement as Consumer Protection. The ICANN rules function to protect the public interest in fair domain practices. Defendants’ violations of these rules not only harmed Plaintiff but also pose a threat to the integrity of the domain registration system that countless other consumers rely on. If Amazon can pick and choose which ICANN rules to follow, registrants everywhere are at risk. Therefore, holding Defendants accountable for these violations is necessary to vindicate the policies and to deter future misconduct by registrars.
	34.	Damages and Relief. As a proximate result of Defendants’ violations of ICANN policies (and the corresponding contractual duties), Plaintiff suffered the same damages as outlined in Count I, which are incorporated here by reference. Plaintiff seeks damages to compensate for his losses attributable to these policy breaches. Additionally, because ICANN’s framework does not provide a direct private lawsuit for enforcement, it is appropriate for this Court to enforce those obligations via this claim. Plaintiff also seeks injunctive relief under this Count (as detailed below in the Prayer) to require Defendants to conform their practices to ICANN rules. This includes an injunction preventing Defendants from acting as a registrar in a manner inconsistent with ICANN policy. Plaintiff, as a third-party beneficiary of the ICANN accreditation agreement, seeks specific enforcement of that agreement’s requirements for the protection of his rights.

COUNT III – Violation of Washington Consumer Protection Act (RCW 19.86)
	35.	Trade or Commerce. Defendants were engaged in “trade or commerce” within the meaning of the Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA), RCW 19.86.010(2), by offering and providing domain registration services to the public (including Plaintiff) for a fee. Domain registration and hosting services are commercial services that directly affect the people of Washington and others who rely on internet commerce.
	36.	Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices. Defendants committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of their trade or commerce, in violation of RCW 19.86.020. The actions described above, including deleting Plaintiff’s domain without notice or justification, constitute unfair practices because they offend established public policy and are unethical, oppressive, and unscrupulous. Specifically, Defendants advertised and promised a reliable domain registration service with safeguards like auto-renewal and compliance with industry standards, yet delivered the opposite by arbitrarily terminating the service. This discrepancy has a capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public – any reasonable consumer would have been misled to believe their domain was safe with Amazon given the promises made. Plaintiff himself was deceived into believing that by transferring to Amazon and enabling auto-renew, his domain would remain secure through its term. Defendants’ failure to disclose that they might delete active domains (or their failure to adhere to required procedures) is a material omission that misled Plaintiff and likely misleads others.
	37.	Unfair Competition and Public Interest Impact. Defendants’ conduct also impacts the public interest and constitutes unfair competition. Amazon is one of the largest domain registrars, with many Washington consumers (and consumers nationwide) entrusting their domains to Route 53. If Amazon ignores ICANN rules and deletes domains at will, this practice could affect a broad segment of the public, not just Plaintiff. Indeed, the Consumer Protection Act is violated when a company’s acts have the potential to injure the public interest. Here, the potential for injury is high: other customers could similarly lose their domains or be strong-armed into paying exorbitant fees to reclaim them, and the trust in the domain registration system could be eroded. Moreover, Defendants’ conduct may give them an unfair competitive advantage over honest registrars; by skirting the rules (for instance, possibly capturing domains for resale), they undermine competition and harm consumers. Thus, the public interest element of the CPA is satisfied.
	38.	Causation and Injury. Defendants’ unfair and deceptive acts caused injury to Plaintiff’s business and property. Plaintiff has lost his domain name (property interest) and the business that flows from it, as detailed. This loss is an injury to his property (the domain is an intangible property asset) and to his business expectancies (the website and clientele). The injury is of the type the CPA is designed to address – financial harm and loss of property due to deceptive or unfair business practices. But for Defendants’ deceptive assurances of safe auto-renewal and unfair act of deletion, Plaintiff would not have suffered this injury.
	39.	Relief Under CPA. Pursuant to RCW 19.86.090, Plaintiff is entitled to relief for Defendants’ CPA violations, including: (a) actual damages in an amount to be proven (covering the value of the Domain and associated losses); (b) an award of up to treble damages (three times the actual damages) as the Court may deem appropriate, given the willful and flagrant nature of Defendants’ conduct, provided that the total trebled award does not exceed the statutory cap (currently $25,000 per person); and (c) an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in bringing this action. Plaintiff also seeks injunctive relief under the CPA to enjoin Defendants from continuing the unfair or deceptive practices. Specifically, as further described below, Plaintiff seeks an injunction prohibiting Defendants from deleting or canceling domain registrations in violation of ICANN rules, and requiring Defendants to implement policies ensuring full compliance with consumer protection standards in domain services. This injunctive relief will serve to protect the public by preventing future harm.

COUNT IV – Conversion
	40.	Property Interest in Domain Name. Plaintiff had a property interest in the Domain, pdfsage.org. Under Washington law, a domain name registration is recognized as an intangible property right of value, which the registrant has the right to use, control, and enjoy exclusively. Plaintiff’s interest in the Domain included the right to continue using it for his website and email, to renew it, to sell or transfer it, and to exclude others from using it. This interest is a form of personal property (sometimes analogized to a license or contractual right), and it is vested in the registrant (Plaintiff) during the registration period and any renewal periods obtained. At the time of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff’s property interest was valid and ongoing, as the Domain was registered in his name and not scheduled to expire.
	41.	Wrongful Dominion and Interference. Defendants, without lawful justification, wrongfully exercised dominion and control over Plaintiff’s property (the Domain) in a manner inconsistent with Plaintiff’s rights. By deleting the Domain registration from Plaintiff’s account and effectively seizing control of it (even if only to drop it from the registry), Defendants deprived Plaintiff of control over the Domain. This act was equivalent to taking away Plaintiff’s property and rendering Plaintiff unable to use or benefit from it. Plaintiff did not consent to this taking. Defendants’ conduct meets all elements of conversion: (a) Plaintiff had ownership or a right to possession of the property; (b) Defendants willfully interfered with that right (by deleting the domain from Plaintiff’s possession/control); (c) the interference deprived Plaintiff of possession or use of the property; and (d) the interference caused damages to Plaintiff.
	42.	Demand and Refusal (Where Applicable). To the extent a demand is required for conversion of intangible property, Plaintiff clearly demanded return/control of his Domain once he discovered the deletion. Plaintiff, through communications to AWS support (Exhibit C and other correspondence), repeatedly requested that his Domain be restored to him. Defendants, however, refused and/or failed to comply with these demands, continuing to withhold the Domain from Plaintiff. Thus, even after being put on notice, Defendants did not remedy their interference, solidifying the conversion claim.
	43.	Damages from Conversion. As a direct result of Defendants’ conversion of the Domain, Plaintiff suffered damages. The Domain itself has significant monetary value, which Plaintiff has lost. The exact value can be established by expert testimony or market value of similar domain names, as well as the value to Plaintiff’s business (goodwill, revenue, etc.). Additionally, Plaintiff lost profits and opportunities due to being unable to operate his website or receive emails at that domain. Plaintiff also incurred expenses trying to mitigate the damage (such as setting up temporary alternative domains or chasing the issue with support and ICANN). Under conversion law, Plaintiff is entitled to recover the full value of the property at the time of conversion, plus any additional losses proximately caused. Plaintiff also seeks any appropriate exemplary damages if the Court finds Defendants acted with malice or reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights (though Washington generally disallows punitive damages absent statutory authorization, the egregiousness here may be considered under CPA trebling or in awarding fees).
	44.	Possession Not Restored. As of the filing of this Complaint, Defendants have not restored Plaintiff’s domain name to him. The conversion is ongoing. If the Domain is permanently lost to a third party due to Defendants’ actions, they will have effectuated a permanent conversion of Plaintiff’s property. Plaintiff therefore seeks both damages for the loss and, where possible, an order compelling the restoration of the property (which overlaps with the specific performance and injunctive relief requests in other Counts).

COUNT V – Negligence
	45.	Duty of Care. Defendants owed Plaintiff a duty of care in handling his domain name registration. Even aside from contractual obligations, a registrar providing critical internet services has a duty to act with reasonable care to avoid foreseeable injury to its customers. This duty includes properly managing renewal processes, safeguarding the domain from erroneous deletion, adhering to industry standards, and generally exercising the level of care that a reasonably prudent registrar would under similar circumstances. Defendants knew or should have known that failing to exercise due care in managing Plaintiff’s Domain would likely result in Plaintiff losing the Domain and suffering economic harm. Because Amazon holds itself out as a reliable service provider, it undertook a duty to use at least ordinary care in preserving customers’ domain registrations.
	46.	Breach of Duty. Defendants breached their duty of care through the acts and omissions detailed above. In summary, Defendants (a) negligently failed to maintain proper records of Plaintiff’s domain registration term and auto-renew status; (b) negligently allowed or caused the domain to be deleted without double-checking its expiration date or the presence of auto-renew (any competent registrar system would have flags to prevent deletion of an active, paid-through domain); (c) failed to follow established protocols that would have prevented this harm, such as sending notices or locking the domain if an issue arose; and (d) failed to timely correct the error once discovered. The deletion appears to have been the result of either a technical error (such as a flawed transfer handling or database mistake) or human error (misidentifying the domain as expired or subject to deletion). Any such error falls below the standard of care for registrars. Furthermore, if the deletion was intentional (even worse), it was grossly negligent or reckless given the lack of basis.
	47.	Causation. Defendants’ negligence was the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s harm. But for Defendants’ mishandling of the Domain, it would not have been deleted in April 2025. It was entirely foreseeable that negligently deleting a customer’s domain would harm the customer by causing loss of the domain and business interruption. Indeed, loss of a domain is the direct and natural result of such negligence. There were no superseding causes; Plaintiff did nothing to contribute to the loss (he had everything in order on his side). The harm flowed directly from Defendants’ actions/inactions.
	48.	Damages. Plaintiff has suffered damages as described, including the loss of the Domain and associated economic losses. In a negligence framework, these are recoverable as they were foreseeable and were actually caused by Defendants’ breach. Plaintiff’s damages in negligence mirror those claimed under breach of contract and conversion: loss of property value, lost profits/business, mitigation costs, etc. While certain contract damages (like purely economic loss) might sometimes be limited by the economic loss rule, here the duty breached is independent of the contract, rooted in public policy and the nature of services (and the economic loss rule may not bar recovery because Defendants’ duties are also established by regulatory policy). Moreover, Defendants’ conduct could be characterized as gross negligence or recklessness, which would remove any limitation on liability and justify the maximum damages allowed by law.
	49.	Gross Negligence / Recklessness. To the extent required, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants were grossly negligent and acted with reckless disregard for Plaintiff’s rights. The sequence of failures – from deletion to lack of notice to refusal to fix – demonstrates more than mere inadvertence; it shows a systemic disregard of essential duties. Defendants knew that deleting a domain like this would cause harm, yet either consciously ignored the risk or failed to put in place the most basic safeguards. Such conduct justifies an award of enhanced damages or, at minimum, underscores the need for injunctive relief to prevent future harm.

V. INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF
	50.	Necessity of Injunctive Relief. Monetary damages alone are inadequate to fully address the harm to Plaintiff and the threat posed by Defendants’ actions. The loss of the Domain represents irreparable injury to Plaintiff’s business reputation and relationships, which cannot be easily quantified. Additionally, there is a continuing risk that Defendants could repeat this behavior with respect to Plaintiff’s other domains (if any) or other consumers’ domains. Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to prevent further harm and to ensure that the Domain (and domains of others) are not mishandled by Defendants going forward.
	51.	Preliminary Injunction. Plaintiff intends to seek a preliminary injunction, and ultimately a permanent injunction, against Defendants. The injunctive relief sought includes: (a) an order prohibiting Defendants (Amazon, Twitch, and any agents or related entities) from acting as a domain name registrar for any domain owned by Plaintiff (including pdfsage.org and any other domains Plaintiff may have with AWS) in a manner inconsistent with ICANN policies – effectively, this means Defendants must refrain from deleting, suspending, or transferring Plaintiff’s domains without either Plaintiff’s consent or a clear authorization under ICANN rules or court order; (b) an order requiring Defendants to immediately take all steps to restore pdfsage.org to Plaintiff’s ownership and control, if it is still possible (through redemption or coordination with the .ORG registry), or to otherwise assist Plaintiff in reacquiring the Domain; (c) an injunction prohibiting Defendants from deleting or canceling any domain names transferred into Route 53 from another registrar without full compliance with ICANN’s requirements (including honoring the original expiration date and providing proper notices and grace periods). This provision is aimed at preventing Defendants from harming other customers in the same way and ensuring Defendants overhaul their transfer and renewal processes; and (d) an order requiring Defendants to suspend offering domain registration services (or at least the deletion of domains) until they certify compliance with all ICANN accreditation rules and have implemented internal safeguards to avoid unauthorized deletions.
	52.	Bringing Registrar Behavior into Compliance. The injunctive relief requested is specifically tailored to enforce ICANN compliance. Plaintiff seeks a Court decree that Defendants cannot continue to operate as an ICANN-accredited registrar in the manner they have been. This may include a requirement that Amazon submit to an independent audit or monitoring of its domain practices, or that Amazon refrain from accepting inbound domain transfers until it demonstrates that its systems will honor existing renewal terms. If Defendants fail to comply, the injunction could empower Plaintiff (or a third party) to notify ICANN and have Amazon’s registrar privileges suspended. The goal is not to shut down legitimate services, but to ensure no further violations occur and that consumers (including Plaintiff) are protected.
	53.	Declaratory Relief. An actual and justiciable controversy exists between Plaintiff and Defendants regarding their rights and obligations in connection with the Domain. Plaintiff therefore also seeks a declaratory judgment pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (RCW 7.24.010 et seq.) declaring that: (i) Defendants’ deletion of pdfsage.org was wrongful and in violation of Plaintiff’s rights; (ii) Plaintiff is the rightful registrant of pdfsage.org and is entitled to immediate restoration of the Domain (or, if it has already been re-registered by a third party, a declaration that it was improperly deleted such that any subsequent registration is void as against Plaintiff’s equitable interest); and (iii) Defendants must specifically perform their obligations under the contract and ICANN policies with respect to Plaintiff’s Domain. This declaratory relief will clarify the parties’ rights and assist in resolving the status of the Domain.
	54.	Public Interest. Both the preliminary and permanent injunction sought serve the public interest. The public has a strong interest in the reliability and fairness of the domain name system. Many individuals and businesses rely on registrars to act in accordance with established rules. Allowing a registrar to operate in defiance of those rules, as alleged here, undermines public confidence. By granting injunctive relief, the Court will not only protect Plaintiff but also encourage all registrars (and particularly these Defendants) to uphold their duties to consumers and the broader internet community.

VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter judgment in his favor and grant the following relief against Defendants Amazon.com, Inc. and Twitch Interactive, Inc., jointly and severally:

A. Compensatory Damages: An award of damages in an amount to fully compensate Plaintiff for the losses incurred as a result of Defendants’ unlawful conduct, including but not limited to the fair market value of the domain name pdfsage.org, lost profits, damage to business and reputation, and consequential damages stemming from the interruption of services.

B. Treble and/or Exemplary Damages: An award of treble damages under RCW 19.86.090 for Defendants’ willful and knowing violations of the Washington Consumer Protection Act, in an amount the Court deems just (up to the statutory maximum), due to the egregious nature of Defendants’ unfair practices. Additionally, any exemplary or punitive damages allowed by law to punish or deter Defendants for conduct showing reckless disregard of Plaintiff’s rights (as may be reflected in the CPA trebling or otherwise permitted).

C. Injunctive Relief: Preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as described in Count V above, including but not limited to: (1) an order restoring Plaintiff as the registrant of pdfsage.org and enjoining Defendants from interfering with Plaintiff’s ownership and use of that domain; (2) an order barring Defendants from deleting, suspending, or otherwise making unavailable any domain name owned by Plaintiff without Plaintiff’s consent or a court order, and requiring Defendants to strictly comply with all ICANN-mandated procedures for domain renewals, transfers, and deletions; (3) an order prohibiting Defendants from acting as a domain registrar for any domains transferred into their system (by Plaintiff or others) unless and until they implement compliant policies and notify this Court of such compliance; and (4) any necessary oversight or auditing provisions to ensure Defendants’ future compliance (such as reporting to the Court or a special master regarding their domain practices for a period of time).

D. Declaratory Relief: A declaratory judgment that Defendants’ actions in deleting the Domain were unlawful and that Plaintiff remains the rightful registrant of pdfsage.org, and that Defendants are obligated to take all necessary steps to effectuate the return of the Domain to Plaintiff.

E. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs: An award of Plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of suit, as permitted by statute (including RCW 19.86.090 for CPA claims) or contract. Given Defendants’ bad faith and the necessity of this action to protect Plaintiff’s rights, an award of fees and costs is warranted to make Plaintiff whole.

F. Pre- and Post-Judgment Interest: An award of pre-judgment interest on any liquidated or ascertainable amounts, and post-judgment interest at the maximum rate allowed by law on all sums awarded, from the date of judgment until paid in full.

G. Such Other Relief as the Court Deems Just and Proper: Any further relief, whether at law or in equity, that the Court deems appropriate. This may include, if necessary, an order directing Defendants to cooperate with the .ORG registry and/or ICANN to facilitate the return of the Domain, or if the Domain has been transferred to a third party, to deposit any proceeds received into Court or otherwise ensure Plaintiff can recover his losses.

DATED: May ___, 2025.
