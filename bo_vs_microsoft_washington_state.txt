Got it. I’ll prepare an improved version of your lawsuit against Microsoft, moving venue to Washington State and strengthening the arguments across all legal claims. This will include formal legal formatting, references to state and federal laws like RCW 19.86 and 15 U.S.C. § 45 (unfair competition), tighter phrasing, and clearer structure for exhibits and evidence. I’ll also include any applicable consumer protection principles, a declaratory judgment request, and cite relevant Washington case law where beneficial.

I’ll let you know as soon as the revised draft is ready.


# COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, FRAUD, UNFAIR PRACTICES, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, AND DECLARATORY JUDGMENT

## Parties

1. **Plaintiff \[Name]** is an individual consumer residing in \[City], \[State]. Plaintiff entered into the transactions described below for personal and/or business use and is proceeding in this action **pro se** (without an attorney).
2. **Defendant Microsoft Corporation** (“Microsoft”) is a Washington corporation with its principal place of business at One Microsoft Way, Redmond, Washington. Microsoft is registered to do business in Washington and conducts substantial business operations in Washington and throughout the United States.

## Jurisdiction and Venue

3. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because Plaintiff asserts claims arising under the laws of the United States, including federal laws prohibiting unfair or deceptive trade practices (15 U.S.C. § 45). The Court also has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) because Plaintiff and Defendant are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds \$75,000, exclusive of interest and costs.
4. The Court has supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiff’s state law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367, as those claims are so related to the federal claim(s) that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the U.S. Constitution.
5. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant because Microsoft is incorporated in Washington and maintains its headquarters in this District, thereby purposefully availing itself of the laws and protections of Washington. Additionally, the claims in this lawsuit arise from Microsoft’s business activities in Washington (including decisions and conduct emanating from its Redmond headquarters).
6. Venue is proper in the Western District of Washington under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because Microsoft resides in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District. Microsoft’s contracts with Plaintiff were entered into, at least in part, through its Washington-based servers and corporate offices, and Microsoft’s misleading representations and failure to act likewise emanated from or were directed by its Washington headquarters.

## Factual Allegations

7. **Overview.** This action arises out of Microsoft’s failure to honor its contractual promises and its deceptive representations regarding a product/service provided to Plaintiff. In summary, Plaintiff agreed to purchase and use a Microsoft product/service based on Microsoft’s explicit assurances of certain features and support. Microsoft breached the agreement by not delivering what was promised, misled Plaintiff about material facts, and retained Plaintiff’s payments despite failing to fulfill its obligations. The following facts detail the events giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims.

8. **Agreement with Microsoft.** On or about \[Date1], Plaintiff and Microsoft entered into a written agreement (the “Agreement”) for the purchase and use of Microsoft’s **\[Product/Service Name]**. A true and correct copy of the Agreement is attached hereto as **Exhibit 1**, which includes the terms and conditions governing the transaction. Under the Agreement, Microsoft explicitly agreed to provide Plaintiff with **\[describe key product/service features or obligations]** in exchange for payment. Plaintiff accepted the terms and fulfilled all prerequisites required to activate the product/service (such as creating an account and accepting Microsoft’s online terms).

9. **Microsoft’s Pre-Contract Representations.** Prior to entering into the Agreement, Microsoft, through its marketing materials and representatives, made specific representations to Plaintiff regarding the quality and capabilities of the \[Product/Service]. For example, Microsoft’s official website and promotional materials described the \[Product/Service] and expressly promised that it **“\[quote specific promise or feature]”** would be included as part of the offering (see **Exhibit 2**, a printout of Microsoft’s advertisement on \[Date] detailing the product features). Additionally, on \[Date2], a Microsoft sales representative assured Plaintiff via email that the \[Product/Service] would **“\[quote salient part of rep’s statement – e.g., meet certain performance standards or include specific functionality]”** (attached as **Exhibit 3**). These representations were material to Plaintiff’s decision to contract with Microsoft, as they addressed the very features and value that Plaintiff sought.

10. **Plaintiff’s Reliance and Payment.** Relying on Microsoft’s above representations and promises, Plaintiff agreed to proceed with the purchase. On \[Date3], Plaintiff paid Microsoft **$\[Amount]** as required under the Agreement (see **Exhibit 4**, a receipt or confirmation of payment to Microsoft). This payment covered the full price of the \[Product/Service] (or the initial installment, subscription fee, or other consideration as specified). By making this payment and continuing to use the service in accordance with Microsoft’s terms, Plaintiff fully performed all material obligations on Plaintiff’s part, thereby satisfying the conditions of the contract (including any applicable fees, duties, or prerequisites for receiving the promised features).

11. **Microsoft’s Failure to Deliver Promised Features/Services.** After the Agreement was in effect and payment was made, Microsoft failed to deliver the \[Product/Service] in the manner promised. Specifically, Microsoft did not provide **\[the key feature, functionality, or level of service]** that it had represented and agreed to provide. For example, **\[describe the breach: e.g., “the software provided to Plaintiff lacked the advertised capability to integrate with certain devices,” or “Microsoft imposed unexpected limitations that were not disclosed in the contract or advertisements, thereby depriving Plaintiff of a core benefit of the bargain.”]** This failure directly contradicts Microsoft’s obligations under the Agreement and the representations it made to induce Plaintiff’s purchase. Plaintiff discovered the missing feature/problem promptly upon using the \[Product/Service] and realized that the actual performance or components fell far short of Microsoft’s promises.

12. **Plaintiff’s Complaint to Microsoft (Exhibit 5).** On \[Date4], immediately after identifying the issues, Plaintiff contacted Microsoft’s customer support in an effort to resolve the problem. Plaintiff sent a written notice/complaint (via email or support ticket) to Microsoft, explaining in detail that **\[describe the problem: e.g., “the \[Product/Service] was not providing \[specific feature] as advertised” or “the service was intermittently unavailable far beyond the promised uptime”]**. In this communication, Plaintiff referenced Microsoft’s earlier promises and the terms of the Agreement, and requested that Microsoft take appropriate action to fix the issue or provide the promised service. A true and correct copy of Plaintiff’s written complaint is attached as **Exhibit 5**. This exhibit shows that Plaintiff clearly articulated the nature of Microsoft’s failure and requested a remedy (such as enabling the missing feature, providing a fix or update, or offering a refund/discount for the deficiency).

13. **Microsoft’s Initial Response (Exhibit 6).** On \[Date5], Microsoft responded to Plaintiff’s complaint in writing (see **Exhibit 6**, Microsoft’s response email/letter). In its response, Microsoft **acknowledged** receipt of Plaintiff’s concerns and **stated** \[summarize Microsoft’s response]. For example, Microsoft **may have** conceded that the issue existed or that certain features were not currently available, but it **claimed** \[if applicable: “that an update would soon restore the feature” or “that the advertised feature was actually only available under certain conditions”]. Alternatively, Microsoft might have **denied** any breach, perhaps pointing to fine print or unsupported justifications (e.g., *“the service is provided as-is”* or an assertion that Plaintiff misunderstood the terms). In any case, Microsoft’s response did **not** immediately resolve the dispute. If anything, Microsoft’s communication left Plaintiff uncertain whether and when Microsoft would fully cure the problem.

14. **Lack of Resolution and Follow-Up (Exhibit 7).** In the days and weeks following Microsoft’s response, the promised features or services remained unavailable or inadequate. Despite Microsoft’s indication that it would address the issue (if any promise was made), the situation did not improve by \[Date6]. Plaintiff continued to experience **\[the same defect or lack of promised feature]**, meaning Microsoft had effectively **failed to cure** the breach. On \[Date6], Plaintiff sent a follow-up communication to Microsoft (attached as **Exhibit 7**). In this follow-up, Plaintiff reiterated the unresolved problems and referenced Microsoft’s prior response. Plaintiff made clear that Microsoft’s failure to act was unacceptable and that Plaintiff would consider legal remedies if the matter was not promptly resolved. This exhibit evidences Plaintiff’s diligence in affording Microsoft an opportunity to honor its promises and fix the situation.

15. **Microsoft’s Final Position (Exhibit 8).** On \[Date7], Microsoft replied again (see **Exhibit 8**). In this final substantive response, Microsoft **refused** to provide the relief Plaintiff requested. Specifically, Microsoft **\[describe refusal or inadequate offer: e.g., “stated that no further action would be taken,” or “offered only a partial refund/credit that did not cover Plaintiff’s losses,” or “maintained that it had the right to alter or remove the feature, citing a clause that Plaintiff contends is inapplicable or unenforceable”]**. Microsoft’s position effectively left Plaintiff without the benefit of the bargain: Microsoft kept Plaintiff’s money but would not deliver the service as promised nor provide an equivalent remedy. At this point, it became clear that informal resolution had failed and that Microsoft had no intention of fully honoring its obligations to Plaintiff.

16. **Plaintiff’s Injuries.** As a direct result of Microsoft’s conduct, Plaintiff has suffered significant harm. **First**, Plaintiff paid for a product/service that was not as represented, meaning Plaintiff did not receive the full benefit of what was bargained for. The value of what Microsoft delivered (absent the promised features/services) is substantially less than the value Plaintiff was promised and paid for. **Second**, Plaintiff expended considerable time and effort in attempts to get Microsoft to fulfill its promises or to obtain support, which resulted in lost productivity and frustration. **Third**, if applicable, Plaintiff incurred additional expenses or losses because of Microsoft’s failure — for example, **\[if relevant: costs to procure alternative solutions, downtime losses to Plaintiff’s business or personal projects, etc.]**. These damages are concrete and calculable in terms of out-of-pocket costs and the diminished value of the product/service.

17. **Impact on the Public & Microsoft’s Pattern of Practice.** Microsoft’s actions described above were not just a one-time accident or innocent mistake; they reflect a broader pattern of unfair business conduct. Microsoft is a large technology company with millions of customers, and the misleading representations made to Plaintiff were part of Microsoft’s standard marketing of the \[Product/Service]. The issue that Plaintiff encountered (the failure to deliver a promised feature/service) is one that could **injure other consumers** in the same way. Indeed, upon information and belief, other customers of Microsoft’s \[Product/Service] may have been given the same promises and may have similarly been left disappointed or defrauded. Microsoft’s **practices have the capacity to deceive** a substantial portion of the public, especially given Microsoft’s reputation and the trust consumers place in its brand. In short, Microsoft’s conduct has a public interest impact: if not enjoined or addressed, it could continue to harm consumers who rely on Microsoft’s representations about its products and services.

18. **Conditions Precedent/Other Notices.** Plaintiff has performed all conditions precedent to Plaintiff’s claims, or such conditions have been waived or excused by Microsoft. Plaintiff gave Microsoft detailed notice of the issues and ample opportunity to cure its breach (through the communications attached as Exhibits 5, 7). Furthermore, any informal dispute resolution or notice requirements in the Agreement have been satisfied to the extent applicable. Despite Plaintiff’s compliance with all relevant procedures and obligations, Microsoft failed to remedy its wrongdoing, necessitating this lawsuit.

## Causes of Action

*(Each Cause of Action is pleaded in the alternative to the extent permitted by law, and all factual allegations above are incorporated by reference into each count.)*

### **Count I – Breach of Contract**

19. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
20. The Agreement between Plaintiff and Microsoft (**Exhibit 1**) is a valid and enforceable contract. The Agreement contains clear promises and obligations binding on Microsoft, including the obligation to provide the \[Product/Service] with the features and quality that were described to Plaintiff. Plaintiff duly performed all of Plaintiff’s obligations under the Agreement, including payment in full and compliance with any applicable terms of use or prerequisites on Plaintiff’s part.
21. Microsoft materially **breached** the Agreement by failing to deliver the \[Product/Service] as promised. Microsoft did not provide the features, functionality, or level of service that it was obligated to provide under the contract. Specifically, Microsoft **failed to \[identify the specific contract provision breached – e.g., “provide the 12-month subscription access with Feature X enabled,” or “deliver a product that meets the described specifications”]**, as detailed in the factual allegations above. This non-performance by Microsoft was not minor or technical; it went to the essence of the Agreement, depriving Plaintiff of a fundamental benefit for which Plaintiff bargained.
22. Microsoft’s breach was **unjustified and unexcused**. There was no force majeure event or other valid legal excuse that would absolve Microsoft from performing its obligations. To the extent Microsoft has pointed to any contract clause in an attempt to excuse its non-performance (for example, a disclaimer or reservation of rights to alter the service), Plaintiff contends that no such clause excuses the conduct here, or that any such clause is invalid/unenforceable under the circumstances (especially given Microsoft’s fraudulent inducement and the consumer protection laws at issue). Plaintiff notified Microsoft of the breach and provided an opportunity to cure (see **Exhibits 5** and **7**), but Microsoft failed to meaningfully cure its breach within a reasonable time.
23. As a direct and proximate result of Microsoft’s breach of contract, Plaintiff has suffered **damages**. These damages include, but are not limited to: **(a)** the amount Plaintiff paid for the product/service (since Plaintiff did not receive the full value of what was paid for), **(b)** the diminished value of the \[Product/Service] as delivered (the difference between the value as promised and as received), **(c)** consequential losses such as costs to obtain replacement products or services, and **(d)** other incidental losses incurred due to Microsoft’s breach (for example, time spent addressing the issue, or business revenue lost due to the product’s deficiencies). The total amount of Plaintiff’s damages will be proven at trial, but is in excess of \$75,000.
24. Plaintiff is entitled to recover all compensatory damages resulting from Microsoft’s breach, in an amount to be determined at trial. In addition, Plaintiff seeks any appropriate **equitable relief** for the breach, such as an order of specific performance or rescission, to the extent monetary damages alone would not make Plaintiff whole. *(Plaintiff pleads rescission in the alternative; see Count V below.)* Plaintiff also seeks an award of pre- and post-judgment interest on any monetary damages, to fully compensate Plaintiff for the loss of use of funds due to Microsoft’s breach.

### **Count II – Fraudulent Misrepresentation**

25. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
26. Microsoft (through its employees, agents, or official communications) made **false representations of material fact** to Plaintiff regarding the \[Product/Service]. These misrepresentations include, but are not limited to: **(a)** Microsoft’s assertion that the \[Product/Service] would have certain capabilities or features (as advertised on its website and in marketing—see **Exhibit 2**), and **(b)** specific promises made directly to Plaintiff by a Microsoft representative that the \[Product/Service] would function in a particular manner or include particular benefits (see **Exhibit 3**). The subjects of these statements (e.g., the availability of *Feature X* or the level of service quality) were **material** facts – meaning a reasonable consumer would consider them important in deciding whether to purchase the product. Plaintiff indeed considered these features/representations important, as they were primary reasons Plaintiff decided to do business with Microsoft.
27. Microsoft’s representations were **false** when made. In reality, the \[Product/Service] did not have the promised features or performance, or Microsoft had not actually committed the resources to deliver the promised level of service. Upon information and belief, Microsoft knew that its representations were false or was reckless in disregarding their falsity at the time they were made. For example, Microsoft either was aware (through internal testing, development roadmaps, or prior customer feedback) that the \[Product/Service] lacked the advertised feature, or Microsoft had no reasonable basis to claim that it would provide the feature within the promised timeframe. Microsoft made these statements intentionally **for the purpose of inducing** Plaintiff (and other customers) to rely on them and purchase the product/service. Microsoft stood to gain financially from such reliance (as indeed it did gain Plaintiff’s payment), providing a motive for its misrepresentations.
28. Plaintiff **justifiably relied** on Microsoft’s false representations. At the time of contracting and purchase, Plaintiff was unaware that the representations were false, and Plaintiff had no reasonable means to discover the truth. Microsoft is a sophisticated party with superior knowledge of its own products, and Plaintiff, as a consumer, reasonably believed Microsoft’s statements to be true. Nothing in Microsoft’s disclosures or the Agreement alerted Plaintiff to the possibility that these representations were untrue. Given Microsoft’s position and explicit assurances, it was reasonable for Plaintiff to trust Microsoft’s statements about its own product. Plaintiff’s reliance on these representations was demonstrated by Plaintiff’s actions: Plaintiff decided to enter into the Agreement and pay the purchase price specifically because of the features and qualities that Microsoft promised. Had Plaintiff known the true facts (that the \[Product/Service] lacked those features or that Microsoft would not deliver on its promises), Plaintiff **would not have** purchased or would have sought different terms or pricing.
29. Microsoft’s fraudulent misrepresentations were a **but-for cause** of Plaintiff’s damages. In other words, Plaintiff would not have suffered the financial loss of paying for this \[Product/Service] (or related losses) if Microsoft had told the truth about the product. By inducing Plaintiff to enter the contract under false pretenses, Microsoft set in motion the chain of events that led to Plaintiff’s monetary loss and other harm. Microsoft’s deceit was also the **proximate cause** of the injury: the harm to Plaintiff was a foreseeable and natural consequence of Microsoft misleading a customer about a product’s capabilities – the customer pays money and does not get what was promised, thereby losing the benefit of the bargain. Plaintiff’s damages attributable to the fraud include the monies paid to Microsoft (which can be considered **rescissory damages** in fraud, restoring Plaintiff to the position before the contract) as well as any additional expenses incurred due to the misrepresentation (such as costs to mitigate the issue or obtain a substitute).
30. Microsoft’s conduct was willful, malicious, and in conscious disregard of Plaintiff’s rights. Microsoft’s fraudulent misrepresentation entitles Plaintiff to relief including rescission of the Agreement and **damages** to compensate for all losses caused by the fraud. Under Washington law, all nine elements of fraud are satisfied by Microsoft’s conduct as alleged. Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks to recover **actual damages** suffered as a result of the fraud, in an amount to be proven at trial. In addition, because Microsoft’s actions were intentional and egregious, Plaintiff asks the Court to award any further relief deemed appropriate to deter such conduct and to prevent Microsoft from unjustly benefiting from its fraud (such as equitable disgorgement of profits or other appropriate **equitable relief**). *(Plaintiff notes that Washington law generally does not permit punitive damages in the absence of statutory authority. Thus, Plaintiff does not seek separate “punitive damages” here, but does seek the enhanced remedies available under the statutes pleaded in other counts, and reserves the right to seek any punitive or exemplary damages if they become available under any applicable law.)*

### **Count III – Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices (Washington Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86.020 et seq.)**

31. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
32. Microsoft’s actions, as described above, constitute **unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce**, in violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA), RCW 19.86.020. Washington law declares unfair or deceptive acts in trade or commerce unlawful, and Microsoft’s conduct meets this standard. In particular, Microsoft **deceived** Plaintiff by misrepresenting material facts about its product (falsely advertising features and making false promises), and also acted **unfairly** by retaining Plaintiff’s money while failing to deliver the promised product/service. These practices had the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public and were contrary to honest business methods. Moreover, such conduct also constitutes unfair methods of competition and deceptive acts in commerce as defined by Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(a) (which, while not directly enforceable by private parties, reflects a strong public policy against the precise kind of conduct engaged in by Microsoft).
33. The acts occurred **in trade or commerce**. Microsoft’s misleading advertisements and sale of the \[Product/Service] to Plaintiff were part of its business of offering goods and services in the marketplace. Microsoft was engaged in commerce, and Plaintiff’s purchase was a consumer transaction. Thus, the deceptive statements and unfair conduct happened in the context of Microsoft’s trade or commerce.
34. Microsoft’s unfair and deceptive acts **affect the public interest**. Microsoft is a multi-national company and the practices at issue are not unique to Plaintiff’s private interaction; rather, they are part of Microsoft’s general course of business in marketing and providing the \[Product/Service] to consumers. The misrepresentations made to Plaintiff were contained in public-facing marketing (Exhibit 2) and standard sales communications, indicating the likelihood that other consumers were or could be exposed to the same deception. Because Microsoft’s conduct has the capacity to deceive large numbers of consumers and occurred in the context of public advertising and solicitation, it is an issue of public interest, not merely a private dispute. Preventing such deceptive and unfair practices is precisely the aim of consumer protection laws.
35. Plaintiff suffered an **injury to Plaintiff’s business or property** as a result of Microsoft’s unfair and deceptive acts. The injury here is **monetary loss**: Plaintiff paid money to Microsoft that, due to Microsoft’s deception, did not yield the expected value. In essence, Plaintiff was overcharged or induced to spend money on something of lesser value than represented. This loss of funds is an injury to “property” under the CPA. Additionally, any other economic harm (such as costs to attempt to remedy the issue, or expenses for alternative solutions) also qualify as injury to Plaintiff’s property. These injuries are concrete, measurable economic harms that Plaintiff directly sustained.
36. Microsoft’s unfair or deceptive conduct was a **proximate cause** of Plaintiff’s injury. But for Microsoft’s false promises and unfair retention of Plaintiff’s payment, Plaintiff would not have suffered the financial losses described. The causal link is clear: Microsoft’s misrepresentations led to Plaintiff’s purchase; Microsoft’s failure to deliver led to Plaintiff not getting what was paid for; and Plaintiff’s losses followed. There is a direct continuum from Microsoft’s acts to Plaintiff’s harm, satisfying the causation requirement under RCW 19.86.090.
37. By reason of the foregoing, Microsoft is liable to Plaintiff for violation of the CPA (RCW 19.86.020, **Unfair Business Practices**). Pursuant to RCW 19.86.090, Plaintiff is entitled to **recover actual damages**, together with the costs of suit, and reasonable attorney’s fees. In addition, because Microsoft’s actions were committed willfully and with knowing disregard of Plaintiff’s rights, Plaintiff requests that the Court, in its discretion, award **treble damages** (up to three times the actual damages sustained) as permitted by RCW 19.86.090. *(Plaintiff acknowledges that any treble damages awarded for a CPA violation are capped by statute at \$25,000 above actual damages for each violation, and Plaintiff respectfully seeks the maximum enhancement the Court deems justified by Microsoft’s conduct.)* Plaintiff also seeks appropriate injunctive relief under the CPA – namely, an order **enjoining** Microsoft from continuing the unfair or deceptive practices alleged herein with respect to other consumers (see Prayer for Relief below), as the CPA expressly allows private parties to seek injunctive relief to bar further violations.

### **Count IV – Unjust Enrichment** *(pleaded in the alternative to Count I)*

38. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein, except that this cause of action is pleaded in the alternative to the breach of contract claim. If, for any reason, the contract (Agreement) between Plaintiff and Microsoft is found unenforceable, invalid, or ineffectual in addressing the wrongful conduct, then Plaintiff seeks relief under the doctrine of unjust enrichment to prevent Microsoft from retaining ill-gotten benefits.
39. **Benefit Conferred:** Plaintiff conferred a **significant benefit** upon Microsoft by paying money to Microsoft (see **Exhibit 4**) for the \[Product/Service]. Microsoft **accepted and retained** this payment. The benefit to Microsoft is the revenue/profit from the transaction, and Microsoft has had use of Plaintiff’s funds from the moment of payment. Additionally, Microsoft benefited by expanding its user base and market share with Plaintiff as a customer, which has ancillary benefits (such as data collection or network effects), though the primary measurable benefit is the **$\[Amount]** (and any other fees) paid by Plaintiff.
40. **Knowledge and Appreciation:** Microsoft had knowledge of and appreciated the benefit conferred by Plaintiff. Microsoft’s billing and accounting records will reflect that it received Plaintiff’s payment. Furthermore, Microsoft’s conduct (responding to Plaintiff’s complaints with partial measures or denials) demonstrates that Microsoft was aware it had Plaintiff’s money and was attempting to **retain** it despite the issues. There is no question that Microsoft was enriched by keeping the funds Plaintiff paid for a product/service that Microsoft did not fully deliver as promised.
41. **Inequity of Retention:** Under the circumstances, it is **unjust** for Microsoft to retain the benefit of Plaintiff’s payment without providing the value that was bargained for. Plaintiff paid for a fully functional, feature-complete \[Product/Service] as advertised and promised. Allowing Microsoft to keep Plaintiff’s money while providing a substandard or deficient product/service would unjustly enrich Microsoft at Plaintiff’s expense. Equity and good conscience dictate that Microsoft should not be permitted to profit from its own misleading conduct and breach of duty. This is especially true given the willful and deceptive nature of Microsoft’s actions – equity does not favor rewarding a party for misconduct by letting them keep ill-gotten gains.
42. **No Adequate Remedy at Law (if no contract):** In the event the Court finds that no enforceable contract governs the subject matter of Plaintiff’s claims (for example, if Microsoft were to successfully disclaim the specific obligation in question or void the contract through its fraud), then Plaintiff has no adequate remedy at law for the wrong of Microsoft retaining the funds. In such case, unjust enrichment fills the gap to prevent a manifest injustice.
43. **Relief Sought:** Accordingly, Plaintiff seeks **restitution** from Microsoft in the amount of the benefit unjustly retained. This typically would be the return of the purchase price (and any other charges) that Plaintiff paid, or the difference in value between what Plaintiff paid for and what was received, as the court finds equitable. The exact amount of restitution will be proven at trial, but Plaintiff alleges it is at least **$\[Amount]** (the purchase price) plus any additional consequential losses that flowed directly to Microsoft (e.g. if Microsoft saved costs by not delivering a feature). Plaintiff also seeks any other relief in equity that the Court deems proper to disgorge Microsoft of unjust gains, such as constructive trust or injunctive orders if necessary. This Count IV is pleaded in the alternative: if the contract (Count I) is fully enforceable and provides complete relief, Plaintiff acknowledges that recovery under both contract and unjust enrichment may not be allowed for the same injury. However, should the contract claim fail or not make Plaintiff whole, the unjust enrichment claim provides a basis for relief to prevent Microsoft from escaping liability for the value it wrongfully obtained.

### **Count V – Declaratory Judgment (28 U.S.C. § 2201)**

44. Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
45. An actual, present, and justiciable **controversy** exists between Plaintiff and Microsoft concerning their respective rights, duties, and obligations under the Agreement, as well as the legality of Microsoft’s conduct. Specifically, the parties dispute whether Microsoft was obligated under the contract and law to provide the features and services promised, whether Microsoft breached those obligations or engaged in unlawful conduct, and what consequences flow from that determination. Microsoft, in its communications, has effectively taken the position that it had the right to withhold or not deliver certain features (or that it has no further obligation to Plaintiff), whereas Plaintiff contends that Microsoft’s actions were wrongful and in breach of contract and statutory duty. This conflicting position on the parties’ rights and obligations presents a ripe controversy appropriate for declaratory relief.
46. Pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202, Plaintiff seeks a **declaratory judgment** from this Court to resolve the outstanding disputes and clarify the legal relations between the parties. Such declaration will serve to finalize the controversy and afford relief from uncertainty. In particular, Plaintiff requests the Court **declare** the following:

* **(a) Contractual Breach:** that Microsoft’s failure to deliver the promised features and services constitutes a **material breach** of the Agreement, and that Plaintiff’s duties under the Agreement (beyond those already performed) are excused as a result of Microsoft’s material breach.
* **(b) Rescission/Contract Voidable for Fraud:** that, due to Microsoft’s fraudulent inducement and deceptive conduct, Plaintiff is entitled, at Plaintiff’s election, to **rescind** the Agreement and receive restitution of all amounts paid, and that any contract terms purporting to limit remedies or shield Microsoft from liability are **unenforceable** in light of Microsoft’s bad faith.
* **(c) Violation of Law:** that Microsoft’s conduct as described herein was **unlawful**, including that it violated the Washington Consumer Protection Act (RCW 19.86.020) by constituting unfair or deceptive acts or practices in trade or commerce. (In making this declaration, the Court would affirm that Microsoft’s actions meet all elements of a CPA violation as a matter of law or fact.) Additionally, that Microsoft’s conduct violated established public policy as reflected in 15 U.S.C. § 45(a), which declares unfair or deceptive acts in commerce unlawful.
* **(d) Enforceability of Contract Clauses:** that any clause in the Agreement that Microsoft has pointed to (or might point to) in defense – for example, clauses limiting Microsoft’s liability, disclaiming warranties, or allowing unilateral change of features – **cannot be enforced** to bar or reduce Microsoft’s liability in this case, due to Microsoft’s own breach and fraudulent conduct (and/or because such enforcement would be unconscionable and contrary to the substantive protections of consumer protection law).

These declarations address the core disputed issues and would govern the future relations between the parties. For instance, a declaration of rescission would entitle Plaintiff to a return of money and terminate any ongoing obligations, whereas a declaration of breach without rescission would clarify that Plaintiff retains rights to damages and that Microsoft cannot enforce any unfavorable contract terms against Plaintiff. Both parties would benefit from the clarity a declaratory judgment provides in knowing their rights and responsibilities going forward.
47\. Such declaratory relief is necessary and appropriate at this time. Plaintiff has a practical interest in resolving uncertainties about the contract and Microsoft’s continuing obligations (or Plaintiff’s right to terminate the relationship without penalty). Without a declaratory judgment, Microsoft’s stance (e.g., that it owes nothing further, or that Plaintiff’s only remedies are limited by contract) may go unchecked, and Plaintiff could be left without clarity on issues such as entitlement to use certain software, eligibility for refunds, or whether Plaintiff must accept certain contract terms. A declaratory judgment would **terminate the controversy** by establishing the parties’ rights, thus preventing further harm. Moreover, resolving these issues has significance beyond just Plaintiff; it may influence Microsoft’s treatment of customers generally by clarifying that such conduct is unlawful and will not be given legal effect. Plaintiff therefore respectfully asks this Court to issue appropriate declaratory relief as outlined above, or as it deems just and proper, consistent with the factual findings it makes in this case.

## Prayer for Relief

**WHEREFORE,** Plaintiff \[Name] prays that the Court enter Judgment in Plaintiff’s favor against Defendant Microsoft, and grant the following relief:

* **Compensatory Damages:** An award of **actual damages** in an amount to be proven at trial, representing the sums paid by Plaintiff to Microsoft and all other monetary losses incurred by Plaintiff as a result of Microsoft’s conduct (including but not limited to expectation damages for breach of contract and out-of-pocket losses caused by the misrepresentations). This includes compensation for the diminished value of the product/service Plaintiff received and any consequential damages stemming from Microsoft’s breach and deception. *(Plaintiff currently estimates these damages to exceed \$75,000, as required by 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a), but the exact amount shall be determined according to proof.)*
* **Statutory Treble Damages:** An award of **enhanced damages** as authorized by the Washington Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86.090, for Microsoft’s willful and knowing deceptive conduct. Specifically, Plaintiff requests that the Court, in its discretion, **increase the award of actual damages up to three times** the amount of actual damages sustained (not to exceed the statutory cap of \$25,000 for each violation of RCW 19.86.020). This trebling is warranted to penalize Microsoft’s egregious conduct and deter similar conduct in the future.
* **Declaratory Relief:** A **declaratory judgment** in accordance with Count V above, declaring the parties’ rights and obligations. This includes declarations that Microsoft materially breached the contract, that Plaintiff is entitled to rescind the contract (or that Plaintiff has no further obligations under it due to Microsoft’s breach), that Microsoft’s conduct was unlawful (in violation of the CPA and public policy), and that certain contract provisions are void or unenforceable as applied here.
* **Equitable Relief / Rescission:** In addition or in the alternative to monetary damages, an order for **rescission** of the Agreement and **restitution** of all amounts Plaintiff paid to Microsoft. Under this relief, the contract would be canceled and Microsoft required to refund Plaintiff, putting the parties back in their pre-contract positions. This remedy is particularly appropriate given the fraudulent inducement and would ensure Microsoft does not profit from its wrongdoing. *(Plaintiff seeks rescission only if it affords greater relief than damages or if the Court finds it more just in lieu of damages.)*
* **Injunctive Relief:** A **permanent injunction** prohibiting Microsoft from engaging in the unfair and deceptive acts and practices described in this Complaint. This may include enjoining Microsoft from making false or misleading representations about its products in the future, and requiring Microsoft to fully disclose material limitations or changes to its products/services to consumers. Such injunctive relief is authorized by statute to prevent further harm to the public, and is warranted given the public interest implications of Microsoft’s conduct.
* **Unjust Enrichment Relief:** An order requiring Microsoft to **disgorge** any unjust enrichment obtained from its conduct and to pay restitution to Plaintiff. (This overlaps with damages or rescission, and would only be needed if those remedies are insufficient. Essentially, Microsoft should not be allowed to retain any benefit from its wrongdoing.)
* **Attorney’s Fees and Costs:** An award of **Plaintiff’s costs of suit**, including court fees and other litigation expenses. Furthermore, although Plaintiff is pro se, to the extent allowable by law (such as under RCW 19.86.090 which permits attorney’s fees to a prevailing consumer), Plaintiff seeks an award of **reasonable attorney’s fees**. *(Plaintiff notes being self-represented, but reserves the right to seek fees if representation is obtained, or to seek recovery of the economic value of legal work performed, as courts may deem appropriate under consumer protection fee-shifting provisions.)* In any event, Plaintiff requests recovery of all costs and disbursements incurred in connection with this action.
* **Pre- and Post-Judgment Interest:** An award of **pre-judgment interest** on all liquidated sums (or sums susceptible to calculation) from the date of loss until the date of judgment, and **post-judgment interest** at the legally prescribed rate from the date of judgment until full satisfaction, so that Plaintiff is fully compensated for the time value of money wrongfully withheld by Microsoft.
* **Such Other Relief as the Court Deems Just and Proper:** Any further relief in law or equity that the Court finds appropriate. Given Microsoft’s conduct, this may include any additional remedies necessary to achieve justice, whether compensatory, equitable, or otherwise.
