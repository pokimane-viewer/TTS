COMPLAINT FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION, UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES, AND UNJUST ENRICHMENT
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
 WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON
[Plaintiff Name], Plaintiff,
 vs.
 MICROSOFT CORPORATION, Defendant.
Case No. ______________
COMPLAINT
Jury Trial Demanded
I. Parties
Plaintiff [Name] is an individual residing in [City, State]. Plaintiff is a customer who used Microsoft’s Azure cloud services as part of a subscription agreement with Defendant. Plaintiff brings this action pro se on his own behalf.


Defendant Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) is a Washington corporation with its principal place of business in Redmond, Washington. Microsoft regularly conducts business nationwide and within this District, including offering the Azure cloud computing platform to consumers and businesses. Microsoft is subject to the jurisdiction of this Court.


II. Jurisdiction and Venue
Subject Matter Jurisdiction: This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (diversity jurisdiction). Plaintiff is a citizen of a state other than Washington, while Defendant is a citizen of Washington (both by state of incorporation and principal place of business). The amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs, as Plaintiff has sustained substantial monetary damages from Defendant’s conduct. In the alternative and to the extent any claims arise under federal law, the Court has federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, with supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1367.


Personal Jurisdiction: Defendant has continuous and systematic contacts with Washington and this District, and has expressly agreed that Washington law governs Azure customer agreements with any disputes to be brought in Washington. By operating headquarters and servers in this state and directing its Azure services and advertising to Washington residents (among others), Defendant has purposefully availed itself of this forum.


Venue: Venue is proper in the Western District of Washington pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as Microsoft resides in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred here. The Azure Online Subscription Agreement designates Washington as the venue for any action to enforce the agreement.


III. Factual Background
Azure Service and Marketing: Microsoft markets Azure as a robust cloud computing service, promising high reliability, scalability, and transparent, cost-effective pricing. In its public materials, Microsoft advertises that Azure allows users to “create highly-available, infinitely-scalable cloud applications” and is “engineered to deploy applications that are scalable, reliable, and inexpensive to operate.” Microsoft’s website assures customers of “simple, transparent pricing” with “no upfront costs or surprises—pay for only what you need.” Defendant’s marketing emphasizes “flexible and transparent pricing” and urges that customers will “only pay for the resources [they] use,” with “no upfront costs or cancellation fees.” These representations were widely disseminated to the public to induce individuals and businesses to choose Azure over competing services.


Plaintiff’s Use of Azure: Relying on these representations, Plaintiff opened an Azure account on or about [Date] and entered into Microsoft’s Azure Subscription Agreement for cloud services. At the time of sign-up, Plaintiff reviewed Azure’s “Pricing Calculator” and service documentation provided on Microsoft’s official website, which indicated that the services Plaintiff needed would be provided at a certain expected performance level and cost. For example, Azure’s materials suggested that Plaintiff could deploy applications at scale with minimal downtime and that charges would align with the advertised rates (with no hidden fees). Plaintiff reasonably believed that Azure would perform as advertised and that costs would remain predictable.


Disparity Between Advertised and Actual Performance: After commencing use of Azure, Plaintiff discovered significant discrepancies between Azure’s advertised capabilities and its actual performance and features provided to Plaintiff. Specific issues included, inter alia:


Limited or Unreliable Service: Azure did not consistently provide the “scalable” and “highly-available” infrastructure promised. Plaintiff experienced prolonged downtimes, resource constraints, and technical failures when attempting to scale resources, contrary to Microsoft’s assurances that Azure was “reliable” and could handle increased demand seamlessly. These technical shortcomings materially deviated from the quality and capabilities advertised by Microsoft.


Pricing and Hidden Charges: The actual charges billed to Plaintiff far exceeded the “transparent… no surprises” pricing that Microsoft promised. For instance, Plaintiff was assessed unexpected fees and usage charges that were not clearly disclosed in the Azure pricing overview. Despite Microsoft’s claim that customers “pay for only what you need” with “no upfront costs or surprises,” Plaintiff was billed for ancillary services and data egress fees that were not part of the understood cost structure. Such hidden or inadequately disclosed charges made Azure significantly more expensive than the advertised rates, frustrating Plaintiff’s financial expectations.


Account Treatment and Support Issues: Microsoft treated Plaintiff’s Azure account in a manner that was unfair and not as advertised for Azure customers. After Plaintiff incurred higher-than-expected charges (due to the hidden fees), Plaintiff raised concerns with Microsoft. Rather than addressing the issues or assisting to optimize costs as a “trusted” partner, Microsoft’s support provided generic or delayed responses. In one instance, Microsoft imposed a usage cap/suspension on Plaintiff’s account without clear justification, severely limiting Plaintiff’s access to services that had been paid for. This unilateral action contradicted the reasonable expectations set by Microsoft’s marketing that all Azure customers would receive reliable service and support.


Microsoft’s Knowledge and Conduct: On information and belief, Microsoft was aware that Azure’s actual performance and pricing structure differed from its public representations. The expansive marketing claims about reliability and cost-effectiveness were made despite internal knowledge of system limitations and complex pricing that ordinary consumers would struggle to decipher. Microsoft failed to adequately disclose material facts, such as the likelihood of certain extra fees (for bandwidth, storage transactions, support tiers, etc.) or the conditions under which small accounts might face service limitations. Microsoft’s knowing failure to reveal such material information is “deceptive” under Washington law. Defendant’s sales and marketing strategy thus relied on misleading impressions to induce customers like Plaintiff to sign up, while relevant details were buried in fine print or not disclosed at all.


Injuries to Plaintiff: As a direct result of Microsoft’s conduct, Plaintiff has sustained concrete injuries. Plaintiff paid substantial sums for Azure services in reliance on the promised capabilities and pricing, but did not receive the benefit of the bargain. Plaintiff incurred financial losses in the form of: (a) fees for services that did not perform as represented (wasted expenditures on unusable or under-performing computing resources), and (b) overpayments due to undisclosed or misleadingly presented charges. Additionally, Plaintiff’s business and projects suffered setbacks because Azure’s unreliability and Microsoft’s account actions disrupted operations. Plaintiff had to spend significant time and money mitigating issues caused by Azure’s failures (such as migrating applications to a different platform and troubleshooting unexpected outages and bills). These damages were proximately caused by Microsoft’s false representations and breach of its obligations, as detailed in the causes of action below.


Exhaustion of Remedies: Plaintiff attempted in good faith to resolve these issues with Microsoft before filing suit. Plaintiff communicated his grievances regarding the service quality and billing irregularities to Microsoft’s customer support and management on multiple occasions (see correspondence attached as Exhibit A). However, Microsoft failed to provide any meaningful relief. Any further informal resolution efforts or contractual dispute resolution procedures (to the extent not waived or inapplicable) have proven futile. Plaintiff therefore proceeds with this lawsuit to seek redress for the harms suffered.


IV. Causes of Action
Each of the following causes of action is pleaded in the alternative to the extent they may overlap, except where double recovery is not permitted. All prior paragraphs are incorporated here by reference for each count below.
Count I – Breach of Contract
Existence of Contract: Plaintiff and Microsoft entered into a valid and enforceable contract for cloud services, namely the Azure subscription agreement (the “Agreement”). Under this Agreement, Microsoft agreed to provide Azure services to Plaintiff in exchange for Plaintiff’s payment of usage fees. The Agreement and incorporated terms imposed various duties on Microsoft, including providing services in accordance with advertised or agreed-upon performance standards (such as specific service levels or descriptions in the Azure Offer Details and documentation) and adhering to the pricing terms extended to Plaintiff. Plaintiff fulfilled all required conditions on his part, including tendering payment when due and complying with applicable Azure Terms of Use and policies.


Microsoft’s Breach of Duties: Microsoft materially breached the Agreement by failing to deliver the Azure services as promised and by not honoring the pricing and service commitments made to Plaintiff. Among other breaches, Microsoft: (a) did not provide cloud services with the quality, reliability, or capacity that a reasonable customer would expect based on the Agreement and Microsoft’s accompanying representations, and (b) charged Plaintiff amounts beyond the agreed pricing structure, effectively negating the benefit of any bargain. The Agreement’s implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was also breached by Microsoft’s acts, as Microsoft unfairly exercised its discretion (for example, imposing unwarranted account restrictions and not disclosing material cost information) in a manner that deprived Plaintiff of the contract’s benefits. Any disclaimers or limitations Microsoft may point to do not excuse these breaches, because Microsoft’s conduct directly contravened the fundamental inducements and purpose of the Agreement.


Causation and Damages: Microsoft’s breach of contract proximately caused Plaintiff harm. Plaintiff suffered foreseeable monetary losses that put him in a worse position than if Microsoft had performed as promised. As a result of Microsoft’s non-performance and overcharging, Plaintiff paid for services he did not fully receive and bore costs (such as mitigating downtime and switching providers) that would not have arisen absent Microsoft’s breach. These damages include, but are not limited to: the difference in value between the service level paid for and that actually provided, excess fees improperly charged to Plaintiff, and consequential losses from business interruptions. Under Washington law, “[t]o prevail on a breach of contract claim, a plaintiff must show that a contract exists, that the contract imposes a duty, that the defendant breached that duty, and that the breach proximately caused damage to the plaintiff.” All of these elements are met here. Plaintiff had a valid contract; Microsoft’s duties under that contract (to deliver the contracted service as advertised and bill properly) were breached; and Plaintiff incurred financial injury as a direct result. Plaintiff is entitled to recover compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial, sufficient to compensate him for the losses incurred and to place him in the position he would have been in had Microsoft performed its promises.


Count II – Fraudulent Misrepresentation (Fraud in the Inducement)
False Representations of Material Fact: Microsoft, through its advertising and online statements, made representations of existing fact that were materially false and misleading. Specifically, Microsoft represented that Azure’s services had certain qualities (high reliability, unlimited scalability, transparent low-cost pricing, etc.) when in reality Azure did not possess those qualities for Plaintiff’s usage. The representations detailed in Paragraph 6 above – such as “scalable, reliable, and inexpensive to operate” cloud infrastructure and “no upfront costs or surprises” in pricing – are statements of fact about Azure’s present capabilities and pricing model, not mere future promises or opinions. These facts were material because a reasonable consumer would consider them important in deciding whether to purchase Azure services. Plaintiff in fact considered and relied on these specific features (performance and cost) in making his decision.


Knowledge of Falsity and Intent: Microsoft knew or was reckless in not knowing that its representations were false or misleading. At the time it advertised Azure in the manners described, Microsoft had superior knowledge of Azure’s actual performance limitations and the complexity of its fee structures. Internal information (which will be explored in discovery) presumably showed that many Azure customers, especially new or small-scale users, could encounter hidden costs or reliability problems. Microsoft nonetheless highlighted only the positive aspects and omitted mention of significant drawbacks or conditions. The timing, content, and ubiquity of Microsoft’s statements demonstrate an intent to induce reliance by potential customers. Microsoft’s goal in making these representations was to encourage Plaintiff (and others in the public) to contract for Azure services, thereby boosting Microsoft’s revenues. Microsoft’s marketing strategy was calculated to create a distinct impression of Azure’s value that it knew was not wholly accurate, indicating intent to deceive or at least to induce action on a false premise.


Plaintiff’s Reliance was Justified: Plaintiff was unaware that the representations were false and in fact reasonably relied upon them in deciding to use (and continue using) Azure. Given Microsoft’s position as a reputable technology company and the definitive, factual nature of its advertising statements, Plaintiff had no reason to doubt the truth of the claims at the time. Plaintiff reviewed Microsoft’s Azure materials (including web pages and documentation) which uniformly touted the benefits without warning of the inconsistencies later experienced. Plaintiff, lacking Microsoft’s inside knowledge, justifiably assumed the service would function and be billed as represented. Plaintiff’s reliance on Microsoft’s statements and omissions was reasonable under the circumstances. Indeed, the information asymmetry meant Plaintiff had to trust Microsoft’s descriptions of its own product. Had Plaintiff known the true facts (for example, that Azure’s pricing was not actually “transparent” and that significant charges could accrue beyond the advertised rates, or that the service might not handle scaling as claimed), he would not have entered the Agreement or would have negotiated different terms or safeguards.


Damages from Fraud: Microsoft’s fraudulent misrepresentations and concealments were the proximate cause of Plaintiff’s injuries. Plaintiff was induced to contract for and spend money on Azure services that did not deliver the advertised value. In essence, Plaintiff did not get what he paid for, and incurred additional costs, because he was misled about what he would be paying for in the first place. The difference between Azure as represented and Azure as provided constitutes damage in the form of overpayment and lost benefits. In addition, Plaintiff invested time and resources based on Microsoft’s false assurances (such as migrating projects to Azure, expecting it to be cost-effective and reliable), and those resources were wasted or diminished in value due to the fraud. Under Washington law, to establish fraud (fraudulent misrepresentation), a plaintiff must plead and prove nine elements, including a false representation of an existing material fact, the speaker’s knowledge of falsity, intent to induce reliance, the hearer’s ignorance of falsity, justifiable reliance, and consequent damages. All nine elements are present here: Microsoft’s statements were false, material, made with knowledge (or reckless disregard) and intent; Plaintiff was ignorant of the falsity, justifiably relied, and was damaged as a result. Therefore, Microsoft is liable for fraudulent misrepresentation.


Aggravation and Independent Duty: Microsoft’s conduct was particularly egregious because it involved a large-scale corporate advertising scheme, not an isolated statement. Even if a contract exists between the parties, Microsoft had an independent duty not to induce Plaintiff’s agreement through fraud. The fraud is independent of the contract in that it occurred in Microsoft’s pre-contractual statements and marketing, which induced Plaintiff to enter the contractual relationship under false pretenses. As such, Microsoft cannot shield itself behind the contract to avoid tort liability for fraud. Plaintiff seeks damages for fraud in addition to, or in the alternative to, contract damages. These damages include all out-of-pocket losses and benefit-of-the-bargain losses attributable to Microsoft’s misrepresentations, as well as potential exemplary damages as allowed by law (recognizing that Washington generally does not allow punitive damages absent statutory authorization, but the Consumer Protection Act may provide for enhanced damages as discussed below). Plaintiff also seeks any appropriate equitable relief (such as rescission of the Agreement and restitution of monies paid) due to Microsoft’s fraudulent inducement.


Count III – Unfair and Deceptive Acts or Practices (Violation of Washington Consumer Protection Act, RCW 19.86.010 et seq.)
Trade or Commerce: Microsoft’s acts and practices as described above occurred in the conduct of trade or commerce. Microsoft offers Azure services in the marketplace and engages in advertising and sales to the general public. Plaintiff’s transactions with Microsoft for Azure services were in the context of Microsoft’s business of providing cloud computing services for a fee.


Unfair or Deceptive Act or Practice: Microsoft committed unfair or deceptive acts or practices within the meaning of the Washington Consumer Protection Act (CPA), RCW 19.86.020. A representation is “unfair or deceptive” if it has the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public. As detailed, Microsoft’s marketing of Azure was affirmatively misleading and also misleading by omission. Advertising cloud services as high-quality and low-cost while failing to disclose material limitations is the type of conduct that tends to mislead consumers. Microsoft’s false promises about Azure’s scalability, reliability, and transparent pricing (¶6–9) had the capacity to deceive many potential customers, not just Plaintiff. In fact, these statements were not only capable of deceiving, but actually did deceive Plaintiff (and likely other consumers) into believing Azure was a better and cheaper service than it truly was. Additionally, Microsoft’s act of imposing undisclosed charges and unilateral account restrictions on Plaintiff can be deemed unfair in that it caused consumer injury that Plaintiff could not reasonably avoid and was not outweighed by any countervailing benefit. No intent to deceive is required for CPA liability; however, here Microsoft’s knowing misrepresentations and failures to disclose certainly meet any intent standard as well.


Public Interest Impact: Microsoft’s unfair/deceptive conduct occurred in the context of its regular business of marketing Azure to the public at large, and thus affects the public interest. Under Washington law, Plaintiff must show that the act “has the capacity to deceive a substantial portion of the public” or that it is part of a pattern with potential repetition to other customers. Here, Microsoft’s Azure advertising campaign was broadly disseminated; it was not a private communication unique to Plaintiff. The false claims about Azure were published on Microsoft’s website and in other media accessible to countless consumers. The injuries caused are therefore not isolated – other consumers either have been or will be similarly misled, or are at risk of incurring unexpected costs or poor service after being lured by the same representations. Courts recognize that such broadly directed false advertising satisfies the CPA public interest element. Indeed, the Washington Supreme Court’s Hangman Ridge decision established that a private consumer transaction involves the public interest if the acts were part of the defendant’s general course of business, were advertised to the general public, or had the potential for repetition. Microsoft’s acts check all those boxes. Preventing large companies from misleading consumers through advertising is squarely within the CPA’s purpose of protecting the public.


Injury to Business or Property: Plaintiff suffered injury to his business or property as a direct result of Microsoft’s unfair and deceptive acts. The CPA requires a showing of injury to one’s business or property, which can include monetary losses (it does not require personal injury, and “business or property” is broadly construed). As described, Plaintiff lost money due to paying for a service under false pretenses – this includes paying for capabilities not delivered and paying overcharges that were deceptively concealed. These financial harms are injuries to Plaintiff’s property (money). Furthermore, Plaintiff’s business endeavors relying on Azure were harmed (e.g., loss of potential revenue or increased costs of doing business due to Azure’s failures). Under the CPA, even relatively small monetary injuries or measurable inconveniences can satisfy this element (injury need not be “quantifiable damages” so long as there was an unfair cost or deprivation of use of property). Plaintiff’s injuries here are concrete and appreciable, as evidenced by the excess charges billed (documented in billing statements, Exhibit B) and the economic value of time and opportunities lost addressing Azure’s shortcomings.


Causation: Microsoft’s deceptive conduct caused Plaintiff’s injuries. Plaintiff would not have signed up for Azure or incurred these expenses but for Microsoft’s deceptive representations of quality and cost. The chain of causation is direct: the misleading information led to Plaintiff’s purchase, and the purchase led to the financial losses when the truth came out through experience. Under RCW 19.86.090, a causal link between the unfair act and the injury must be shown; here, Microsoft’s false advertising and omissions induced Plaintiff’s reliance and usage of Azure, thereby directly causing the monetary losses when Azure did not perform as promised. There is a clear causal relationship between the representations (Azure is low-cost and reliable) and the harm (Plaintiff paying more for an unreliable service).


Violation of CPA: By satisfying all five elements of a private CPA claim – (1) unfair or deceptive act or practice, (2) occurring in trade or commerce, (3) public interest impact, (4) injury to business or property, and (5) causation – Microsoft has violated RCW 19.86.020 (the CPA’s prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts). Plaintiff, as a consumer injured by these practices, has a cause of action under RCW 19.86.090. Pursuant to the CPA, Plaintiff seeks all remedies available, including actual damages, injunctive relief, and attorney’s fees and costs. Microsoft’s conduct being willful and knowing also potentially warrants treble damages under the statute. The CPA grants the Court discretion to award up to three times the actual damages sustained, not to exceed $25,000, for a violation. Here, an award of treble damages is justified to deter Microsoft and affirm that such deceptive conduct toward consumers is egregious. Plaintiff specifically prays for an award of treble damages to the maximum extent allowed by law, given the willful nature of Microsoft’s deception.


Injunctive Relief in the Public Interest: In addition, Microsoft’s ongoing practices should be enjoined. Unless restrained by an order of the Court, Microsoft is likely to continue using misleading marketing and unfair billing practices with respect to Azure (and possibly other services), which will harm the public. Under RCW 19.86.090, any person may seek injunctive relief against CPA violations. Plaintiff therefore seeks an injunction prohibiting Microsoft from engaging in the deceptive advertising and requiring full disclosure of Azure’s true capabilities and pricing in future communications. Such injunctive relief will serve the public interest by preventing future consumers from being misled in the same way.


Count IV – Unjust Enrichment
(Pled in the Alternative, in the event no enforceable contract governs certain aspects of the dispute.)
Benefit Conferred: Plaintiff conferred a benefit upon Microsoft in the form of payments for Azure services and valuable customer business/data. Over the course of Plaintiff’s Azure usage, Plaintiff paid Microsoft substantial sums of money (detailed in billing records) for subscription fees, service usage, and overage charges. These funds directly benefited Microsoft’s revenue. Microsoft has received and retained these monetary benefits. Additionally, Microsoft benefited from Plaintiff’s use of Azure by being able to tout user adoption and potentially using Plaintiff’s feedback or data to improve services or marketing (a form of indirect benefit).


At Plaintiff’s Expense: The benefit Microsoft received was at Plaintiff’s expense. Every dollar paid to Microsoft came out of Plaintiff’s pocket or business resources. Plaintiff received services of lesser value than what was paid, meaning Microsoft was enriched not just by legitimate payment for equal value, but by an excess at Plaintiff’s expense. Plaintiff’s loss (money paid for unreliable/overpriced service) corresponds to Microsoft’s gain (money it should not have collected under honest circumstances). Thus, Microsoft’s enrichment correlates with Plaintiff’s impoverishment.


Unjust Circumstances: Under the circumstances, it would be unjust for Microsoft to retain the benefit of these payments without compensating Plaintiff. Unjust enrichment under Washington law has three elements: “(1) the defendant receives a benefit, (2) the received benefit is at the plaintiff’s expense, and (3) the circumstances make it unjust for the defendant to retain the benefit without payment.”. Microsoft’s retention of Plaintiff’s payments is unjust because the payments were induced by false pretenses and the fundamental purpose of the transactions was frustrated by Microsoft’s misconduct. Equity and good conscience dictate that Microsoft should not profit from providing a substandard service via deceptive means. If the contract claim for some reason does not provide a remedy (for example, if portions of Microsoft’s conduct are deemed outside the strict contract terms or if the contract were voided due to fraud), then unjust enrichment serves as a vehicle to require restitution. Microsoft’s enrichment was not a result of mere happenstance or a voluntary gift; it was obtained through misleading inducements and failure to deliver commensurate value. Allowing Microsoft to keep these ill-gotten gains would effectively sanction its wrongful conduct. Washington courts emphasize that “enrichment alone will not suffice… it is critical that the enrichment be unjust both under the circumstances and as between the two parties”. Here, Microsoft’s enrichment meets that test: Plaintiff paid in expectation of a certain service, Microsoft kept the money despite not fulfilling the basic expected obligations – this inequity between Plaintiff and Microsoft should be rectified by the Court.


No Adequate Legal Remedy (if applicable): Plaintiff pleads unjust enrichment in the alternative. If the contract is deemed void, unenforceable, or otherwise not covering certain relief, or if Plaintiff is not allowed to recover under contract or tort for any portion of his loss, then unjust enrichment should apply. There is no adequate remedy at law to prevent Microsoft’s windfall in that scenario. Thus, if necessary to avoid injustice, Plaintiff seeks restitution of the benefits conferred – namely, a refund or disgorgement of all monies paid by Plaintiff to Microsoft that in equity should not be retained by Microsoft. The measure of this restitution may be the amount by which Microsoft was unjustly enriched or the amount of Plaintiff’s detriment, whichever is appropriate. This includes refunding fees associated with the undisclosed charges and compensating the value of any performance shortfall.


By virtue of the foregoing, Microsoft has been unjustly enriched, and Plaintiff is entitled to relief including restitutionary damages in an amount to be determined, together with pre- and post-judgment interest as allowed by law.


V. Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff [Name] respectfully prays for relief against Defendant Microsoft Corporation as follows:
A. Compensatory Damages: An award of actual damages in an amount to fully compensate Plaintiff for the losses incurred as a result of Defendant’s conduct, including but not limited to: payments made for unreliable or non-conforming Azure services, excess charges billed under false pretenses, and consequential losses caused by service failures. This amount will be proven at trial and is presently estimated to exceed $__________.


B. Treble Damages (CPA): For the Third Cause of Action (CPA violation), an award of treble damages up to three times the actual damages, as permitted by RCW 19.86.090, due to Defendant’s willful and knowing deceptive acts, not to exceed $25,000 for the trebled portion.


C. Equitable Relief / Rescission: In the alternative or in addition to damages, an order of rescission cancelling the Azure subscription Agreement (if not already terminated) and restitution of all amounts paid by Plaintiff under that Agreement, on the ground of fraudulent inducement and/or unjust enrichment.


D. Injunctive Relief: A permanent injunction prohibiting Microsoft from engaging in the unlawful and deceptive practices described herein. This injunction should, at minimum, enjoin Microsoft from misrepresenting material information about Azure’s capabilities or pricing in its marketing, and require Microsoft to fully and prominently disclose any material limitations or fees associated with Azure services in future communications. The injunction should also require Microsoft to implement a fair and transparent process for existing Azure customers to obtain redress or clarify the true terms of service, in order to prevent ongoing harm to the public.


E. Attorneys’ Fees and Costs: An award of reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs of suit incurred, as allowed by statute (including RCW 19.86.090 for the CPA claim, which provides for recovery of fees by a prevailing consumer) and/or applicable contract provisions. (Plaintiff acknowledges being pro se at this time, but reserves the right to seek fees for any counsel retained, and in any event seeks allowable costs).


F. Pre- and Post-Judgment Interest: An award of pre-judgment interest on liquidated sums and post-judgment interest at the maximum rate allowed by law, to compensate Plaintiff for the loss of use of money due to Defendant’s wrongdoing.


G. Such Other Relief as the Court Deems Just: Any further relief in law or equity that the Court deems just and proper, including punitive or exemplary damages if and to the extent available (for example, if another jurisdiction’s law is found to apply that would allow such damages, or as further multiplier under consumer protection statutes), and any other remedial orders to correct or ameliorate the effects of Defendant’s wrongful conduct on Plaintiff and the public.
