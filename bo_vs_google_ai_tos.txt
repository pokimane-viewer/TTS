Understood. I’ll begin drafting a civil complaint for you, Bo Shang (pro se), in Santa Clara, California, alleging antitrust and unfair competition violations by Google. The claims will focus on Google’s policy restricting the use of its generative AI content for building or training other AI models, and will seek both damages and injunctive relief. I’ll also reference relevant laws including the Sherman Act and California’s Unfair Competition Law.

I’ll notify you when the draft is ready for review.


# Complaint for Antitrust Violations and Unfair Competition

## Introduction

Plaintiff **Bo Shang**, proceeding pro se, brings this civil action against **Google LLC** for engaging in anti-competitive and unfair business practices. Google, a dominant force in search and artificial intelligence (AI) markets, has imposed terms of service that prohibit users from using content generated by Google's AI services to develop or train other AI models. Plaintiff alleges that this policy is an unlawful restriction on competition and an abuse of Google's market dominance. By blocking users (including developers and researchers like Plaintiff) from using Google’s generative AI outputs in the development of new or competing AI models, Google is stifling innovation, chilling lawful development in the AI field, and maintaining an unfair competitive advantage. Plaintiff seeks relief under federal antitrust laws, including Sections 1 and 2 of the **Sherman Act**, as well as under California’s **Unfair Competition Law** (Business & Professions Code § 17200), to halt and remedy Google’s anti-competitive conduct. Plaintiff accordingly prays for injunctive relief to invalidate the offending terms, as well as damages for the harm caused.

## Jurisdiction and Venue

1. **Federal Question Jurisdiction:** This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because Plaintiff’s claims arise under federal antitrust law, including Section 1 and Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2). Plaintiff brings this action to obtain injunctive relief and damages as authorized by sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 15, 26) for violations of the Sherman Act.

2. **Supplemental Jurisdiction:** To the extent Plaintiff asserts state law claims (including under California Business & Professions Code § 17200 **et seq.**), this Court has supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367, because those claims are so related to the federal antitrust claims that they form part of the same case or controversy.

3. **Personal Jurisdiction:** Defendant Google LLC (“Google”) is headquartered in California (in Santa Clara County) and conducts substantial business within California and this District. The claims arise out of Google’s conduct in California and its terms of service governing services used by Plaintiff in California. Accordingly, the Court has personal jurisdiction over Google.

4. **Venue:** Venue is proper in the Northern District of California under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (c) because Google resides in this District and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District. Google’s relevant policies were devised and enforced from its California offices, and Plaintiff’s use of Google’s services (and the impacts of the policies) occurred in California, including Santa Clara County.

5. **Intradistrict Assignment:** This action is properly assigned to the San Jose Division of this District, as the action arises in Santa Clara County where Google’s principal place of business is located and where Plaintiff resides and engaged with Google’s services.

## Parties

* **Plaintiff Bo Shang:** Plaintiff is an individual residing in Santa Clara, California. He is a software developer and AI enthusiast who has utilized Google’s platforms such as Google Colab and Google’s Vertex AI services for developing and testing machine learning models. Plaintiff is representing himself (pro se) in this matter. Plaintiff has been directly impacted by Google’s policies that restrict the use of generative AI outputs, as described further below.

* **Defendant Google LLC:** Defendant Google LLC is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Mountain View, California (within Santa Clara County). Google LLC is a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. and is one of the world’s largest technology companies. Google provides a broad range of products and services, including the Google Search engine, cloud computing services, and generative AI platforms (such as the **Google Generative Search** feature, the **Bard/Gemini** AI chatbot, and **Google Cloud’s Vertex AI** machine learning services). Google does business throughout California and the United States. At all relevant times, Google was acting as an employer of thousands of persons and as an entity engaged in interstate commerce, with its anticompetitive policies affecting commerce and trade in the field of AI and internet services.

## Factual Allegations

### Google’s Dominance in Search and AI Services

6. **Market Power:** Google is a dominant player in multiple technology markets, including the market for general online search. In a recent federal antitrust case, a U.S. court found that Google operates an illegal monopoly in the general search market. Google’s share of the search engine market has exceeded 85–90%, giving it unparalleled influence over how information is accessed online. Google has also monopolized related markets such as search advertising. This dominance is not only historical but continuing, and it provides Google with the power to set terms that users and business partners must accept.

7. **Expansion into Generative AI:** With the rise of generative AI (artificial intelligence that produces human-like text, images, code, and other content), Google has leveraged its resources and dominance to become a key provider of generative AI services. Google has developed large language models and generative AI systems (e.g., the model known as **Gemini** and its predecessor **PaLM**), and integrated generative AI into its products. For example, Google’s search engine now offers a **Search Generative Experience** (an AI-powered summary of search results) and the **Bard** chatbot (now evolving into “Gemini Assistant”), which provide generative content to users in response to queries. On the enterprise side, Google’s **Vertex AI** platform on Google Cloud allows developers to access Google’s models (like text and image generation models) via APIs and to build applications with them.

8. **Market for Generative AI Platforms:** The emerging market for generative AI platforms and foundation models is highly concentrated, with only a few major providers (Google among them) possessing the advanced models, computational infrastructure, and data necessary to develop cutting-edge AI. Google’s strong position in search and cloud services gives it a significant advantage in this AI market. Indeed, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has argued that Google’s monopoly in search, and its control of the massive search index and user data, could give Google an unfair advantage in dominating generative AI as well. The DOJ presented evidence that Google’s “stranglehold” on search is already preventing rival AI companies from growing and competing on equal footing. In other words, Google’s existing dominance in one market (search) can be leveraged to tilt the playing field in the adjacent market of AI models and services.

9. **Plaintiff’s Reliance on Google’s Services:** As a developer and researcher, Plaintiff Bo Shang found Google’s tools to be important for his work. He has used **Google Colab**, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook service, to experiment with machine learning code and models. He also explored **Vertex AI** on Google Cloud to access Google’s generative AI models for tasks such as natural language processing. Given Google’s prominence, Plaintiff reasonably expected to use these tools and the content they generate to advance his own AI development projects. Google Colab provides the computing resources and environment convenient for AI experimentation, and Vertex AI offers ready access to powerful models that would be costly or impractical to develop from scratch. Thus, Plaintiff (like many innovators in the field) depended on Google’s services as a platform for research and development in AI.

### Google’s Policy Prohibiting Use of Generative AI Output to Develop Other Models

10. **The Restrictive Term of Service:** In 2023, Google introduced additional terms of service specific to its generative AI offerings. Buried within those terms is a critical restriction that is the focus of this lawsuit: users are forbidden from using Google’s generative AI services *to create or train other AI models*. Specifically, Google’s **Generative AI Additional Terms of Service** stated: *“You may not use the Services to develop machine learning models or related technology.”*. In practical effect, this means that if a user obtains any output from Google’s generative AI (for instance, text, code, or images generated by Google’s AI), they are not allowed to feed that output into their own machine learning model or use it to build or improve any AI system. Google has likewise imposed similar use restrictions in product-specific terms (for example, the **Gemini API Terms** prohibit using the service to develop models that compete with Google’s, or to reverse-engineer Google’s models). All users of Google’s AI services must agree to these terms as a condition of access.

11. **Plaintiff’s Attempt to Develop an AI Model:** In mid-2024, Plaintiff began working on developing his own AI language model as part of a personal project aimed at creating an innovative chatbot for educational purposes. Lacking the enormous data and computational power that Google possesses, Plaintiff sought creative ways to train and refine his model. One approach in the AI field is known as “knowledge distillation” or “model distillation,” where a smaller model is trained using outputs from a larger, more advanced model as a guide. Plaintiff considered using Google’s generative AI outputs as a teaching tool for his smaller model – for example, by inputting various questions into Google’s Bard (or Vertex AI text model) and collecting the answers to use as part of the training data for his own AI. This method is a recognized, lawful technique in AI development: it essentially treats the larger model as an informative resource. In general, **analyzing or learning from another model’s outputs (even through reverse engineering) is a common and legal practice among AI researchers**. Many open-source AI developers employ such techniques to improve models without directly copying any underlying proprietary code or weights.

12. **Interaction with Google Support:** Before proceeding further with that plan, Plaintiff grew concerned about Google’s terms of service. The broad language of the restriction (“may not use the Services to develop machine learning models”) alarmed him. In or around August 2024, Plaintiff reached out to Google’s customer support to seek clarification on this policy. He inquired whether using content generated by Google’s AI (such as text from the Bard chatbot or outputs from a Vertex AI API call) as part of the training data for another model would violate Google’s terms. A Google support representative responded and confirmed Plaintiff’s fears: **Google indicated that such use is indeed disallowed**. The support agent pointed to Google’s policy and explained that users are not permitted to use generative outputs to create or enhance other AI models, as that would be considered a violation of the service terms. Plaintiff was further warned (explicitly or implicitly) that violating these terms could result in penalties, such as suspension of his Google account or legal consequences under the terms of service.

13. **Chilling Effect on Plaintiff’s Project:** As a direct result of Google’s policy and the support response, Plaintiff felt compelled to abandon or substantially alter his approach to developing his AI model. Using Google’s AI outputs for training – which seemed a promising avenue – was now off-limits without risking Plaintiff’s access to essential tools (like Colab or Google Cloud) or worse. This put Plaintiff at a significant disadvantage. He had to explore inferior or more cumbersome methods to gather training data, which delayed his project and diminished its potential quality. Plaintiff also incurred additional costs and effort, for example, by having to manually create training data or pay for alternative AI services that might not have the same restriction. In short, Google’s policy **chilled Plaintiff’s lawful development efforts**. Faced with the world’s largest AI provider barring a common technique, Plaintiff was left unsure of what resources he could safely use, causing him to lose time, money, and the ability to fully pursue an innovative idea.

14. **Lack of Meaningful Alternative and Widespread Impact:** Google’s restrictive policy is especially harmful because Google’s services are, in many respects, unavoidable or unmatched for those working in AI. Google’s Colab provides free or affordable computing power that many independent developers rely on. Google’s Vertex AI and models like Gemini are among the most advanced, and getting output from them can be extremely valuable for research. While other AI providers (such as OpenAI’s GPT-4) exist, many of them have similar restrictions and, importantly, may not be as easily accessible or integrated into the developer’s workflow as Google’s services. Moreover, Google’s search engine (with its new generative answers) is a ubiquitous tool; if the content from a Google search AI snippet cannot be used in other contexts, it restricts even the use of information in training data. The policy thus threatens a broad swath of users and developers: it sends a message that **attempting to build a competing or complementary AI system using Google-provided information is prohibited**. This not only harms Plaintiff but also undermines competition and innovation generally, as detailed further below.

15. **No Legitimate Justification – Only Protectionism:** Google’s likely justification for this policy is to prevent competition and protect its proprietary advantage. From Google’s perspective, if developers could freely use the output of Google’s expensive models to train their own systems, some might eventually create competing AI models at lower cost (sometimes called “model distillation”). In fact, industry observers have noted cases of upstart companies attempting to distill knowledge from big models to create cheaper alternatives. Rather than compete on merit or quality, Google has chosen to simply ban this practice in its Terms of Service, effectively using its leverage to forbid an entire avenue of competition. There is no legitimate pro-consumer or pro-competitive rationale for this blanket ban. The output that Google’s AI services provide to users is information – often derived from the public domain or from users’ own inputs – and once a user has it, using it to advance technology should be lawful. By contractually prohibiting it, Google is aiming to **lock down its AI ecosystem**, ensuring that it alone can use the fruits of its AI and massive data troves to improve AI models. This policy functions to **maintain Google’s dominance** by handicapping would-be competitors (like Plaintiff, in a modest sense, or other AI startups in a larger sense) who might otherwise benefit from Google’s services as a stepping stone. The effect is to **foreclose competition** and creativity that might challenge Google’s position.

16. **Harm to Competition and Innovation:** Google’s conduct has a substantial anticompetitive effect. It deprives the marketplace of new or improved AI models that could have been developed if Google’s outputs were usable by others. It raises barriers to entry in the AI field, since any new entrant cannot leverage the leading AI systems’ outputs and must reinvent the wheel or settle for less effective training data. The policy thus **reduces the overall pace of innovation** in AI to the detriment of consumers and society, who benefit from more competition and better AI tools. Even established companies are affected – for example, during the DOJ’s recent antitrust case, executives from OpenAI and other companies testified that Google’s control of search data (and by extension AI outputs from search) is hampering their ability to build competitive AI products. In essence, Google’s policy extends its monopoly in search and search data into a **monopoly over AI knowledge**: by fencing off the outputs of its AI, Google is asserting exclusive control over a resource that could help others compete. This conduct is precisely the kind of thing that antitrust and unfair competition laws are meant to prevent.

### Antitrust Injury to Plaintiff

17. **Injury to Plaintiff:** Plaintiff has suffered injury in fact and antitrust injury as a result of Google’s policies and conduct. Plaintiff’s specific project was stymied, causing him economic harm (in the form of wasted expenditures on Google services and alternative solutions, and lost opportunity to develop a potentially valuable AI application). The harm to Plaintiff is inextricably linked to the harm to competition: Plaintiff was both a consumer of Google’s services and a nascent competitor (or developer) in the AI field. By restricting Plaintiff’s use of Google’s AI outputs, Google not only harmed him directly but also *suppressed a competitive threat*, however small, that his project represented. The injury flows from the reduction in competition – Plaintiff was denied a fair opportunity to create a competing or innovative product, which is the type of injury the antitrust laws seek to redress. Similarly, under California’s Unfair Competition Law, Plaintiff has lost money or property (including the value of his time, effort, and expenses incurred) due to Google’s unfair business practices. If not enjoined, Google’s continued enforcement of this anti-competitive policy will further harm Plaintiff by preventing him (and others similarly situated) from pursuing their livelihood and innovation in the AI sector.

## Claims for Relief

### Count I – Violation of Sherman Act § 1 (15 U.S.C. § 1) – Unreasonable Restraint of Trade

18. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

19. Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits “every contract, combination... or conspiracy, in restraint of trade.” Google’s policy and terms of service constitute a **contract** and agreement between Google and the users of its generative AI services (including Plaintiff). The contractual term that **“\[y]ou may not use the Services to develop machine learning models or related technology”** is a provision that restrains trade. It is essentially a **restrictive covenant** or *non-compete clause* imposed on users: in exchange for being allowed to use Google’s AI services, the user agrees not to use any output from those services to develop any potentially competing technology.

20. This restraint is **unreasonable** and anti-competitive. It does not merely limit a user's improper use of Google’s proprietary software (which might be a legitimate concern); rather, it broadly restricts how a user can use information and content that they receive. The effect is to prevent any development of AI models that might compete with Google, using even the most basic output from Google’s systems. The restraint **stifles competition and innovation** without any pro-competitive justification. By imposing this term through a take-it-or-leave-it contract on all users, Google has created a widespread exclusionary arrangement.

21. The relevant market for purposes of analyzing this restraint is, at minimum, the market for **AI model development and generative AI services**. In the alternative or additionally, the relevant market may be defined as the market for **online search and search-related AI services**, insofar as Google’s generative search outputs are covered by the policy. In either market definition, Google holds immense market power (approaching or equating to monopoly power). Users and developers largely **have no practical alternative** to accepting Google’s terms if they wish to access comparable quality AI outputs or search results, given Google’s dominance (Google has been adjudicated to hold monopoly power in general search and wields significant power in the generative AI arena as well). Therefore, this contractual restraint affects a substantial volume of commerce and is not a trivial or ancillary restriction; it has market-wide impact.

22. The anti-competitive effects of the agreement outweigh any conceivable benefit. The policy’s primary effect is to **lock out potential competition** (by preventing others from using Google’s outputs to build competitive models). This reduces consumer choice and technological progress. There is no legitimate business necessity that requires Google to forbid users from reusing AI-generated content — aside from suppressing competition. If Google’s concern is about proprietary data or intellectual property, those interests could be protected by far less restrictive means (for instance, by copyright or confidentiality protections on truly proprietary content, or by simply competing harder). Instead, the blanket ban on using *any* generative content for *any* model development is grossly overbroad. Thus, under the Rule of Reason analysis, this contractual term is an unreasonable restraint of trade in violation of Sherman Act § 1.

23. As a direct and proximate result of this unlawful restraint, Plaintiff and the general public have been injured. Plaintiff’s harm, as described, includes lost opportunities and increased costs, which flow from the reduction in competitive avenues. Competition in the relevant market has been substantially lessened by Google’s conduct, and innovation has been chilled. Plaintiff seeks relief including an injunction to void or cease enforcement of the anti-competitive contract provision, and recovery of damages he incurred due to the restraint (subject to trebling as provided by law).

### Count II – Violation of Sherman Act § 2 (15 U.S.C. § 2) – Monopolization and Attempted Monopolization

24. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

25. Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits monopolization, attempted monopolization, or combinations or conspiracies to monopolize. Google’s conduct, as alleged, constitutes **monopolization and/or an attempt to monopolize** one or more relevant markets, through anti-competitive and exclusionary acts.

26. **Monopoly Power:** Google possesses monopoly power (or, at minimum, substantial market power) in at least the following relevant market: the market for **general online search and search advertising** and the closely related market for **generative AI and large language model services**. Google’s dominance in search is well documented – a federal court has found Google to be a monopoly in general search services. This dominance yields control over invaluable resources like the world’s largest search index and troves of user data. Such resources can be and are used to confer a dominant position in AI (for instance, Google’s AI models leverage its search index and data, giving it a built-in advantage over other AI developers). The generative AI services market, while nascent, is one where Google is one of only a few major players and is uniquely positioned to lead given its integration of AI in popular consumer products (search, Android, etc.) and its massive R\&D capabilities. Google’s market power is evidenced by its ability to impose the restrictive policy universally on users – if Google lacked power, users or developers could simply switch to a different platform, but in reality many cannot afford to avoid Google’s services without severe loss of quality or reach.

27. **Exclusionary Conduct:** Google has willfully maintained and extended its monopoly power through exclusionary conduct, specifically the enforcement of the anti-competitive policy prohibiting use of AI outputs to develop other models. This conduct is **not competition on the merits**; it is a coercive limitation that handicaps others. By using its control over its own AI services (a product over which it is monopolist or gatekeeper) to prevent anyone from leveraging those services in a way that could produce a rival, Google is essentially **denying competitors a necessary input or facility**. This can be analogized to a monopolist in an essential resource refusing to allow others access for competitive use – a form of refusal to deal or denial of an essential facility, implemented via contract terms. Additionally, Google’s policy specifically targets competitive activity (developing machine learning models) and thus shows a clear intent to **exclude competition**. Such intent can also be inferred from the lack of any legitimate justification for the restriction, indicating that the goal is preservation of monopoly control.

28. **Anticompetitive Effects and Specific Intent:** Google’s policy has the effect of impeding current and future competitors in the AI space. The DOJ’s recent arguments (in its case against Google) underscore the real danger that Google will **“use its artificial intelligence products to strengthen its monopoly in online search” and become “the dominant player in AI” by leveraging its advantages**. The policy challenged here is a tool toward that end – it leverages Google’s current dominance (in search and AI services) to squelch would-be rivals. Google’s intent to maintain monopoly power can be inferred from the nature of the policy and context: it specifically prevents competition and had no purpose other than preserving Google’s competitive edge. To the extent the relevant market is considered the emerging market for **generative AI model development**, Google’s actions also constitute **attempted monopolization** of that market. Google has engaged in **exclusionary conduct with a specific intent to monopolize** the generative AI development space, and there is a dangerous probability that Google will succeed, given its starting dominance and the broad reach of its restrictive terms.

29. **Maintenance of Monopoly:** Through the acts described, Google has **maintained its monopoly power** in the relevant markets in violation of Section 2. The policy helped prevent erosion of Google’s dominance by foreclosing a channel through which competition could arise. By stopping developers (like Plaintiff) from using Google’s outputs to improve alternative models, Google insulates its own AI products from comparison and competition. This maintenance of dominance directly harms consumers and competitors, as it preserves higher barriers to entry and limits creative new offerings.

30. **Harm and Causation:** Plaintiff has been injured by Google’s monopolistic behavior, as detailed above. The injury is the type the antitrust laws are intended to prevent and flows from Google’s unlawful act of monopolization. Competition in the relevant market(s) has been harmed, and Plaintiff, as an innovator and consumer, suffered harm as a result. If Google’s policy continues, Google will further entrench its monopoly and potentially succeed in monopolizing the generative AI field, leading to reduced consumer choice, higher costs (due to lack of competition), and a slower pace of innovation. It is in the public interest to enjoin such conduct.

31. **Conclusion (Sherman Act § 2 Claim):** Google’s imposition and enforcement of the anti-competitive restriction constitute monopolization and/or attempted monopolization in violation of 15 U.S.C. § 2. Plaintiff seeks relief including injunctive measures to stop Google from enforcing this policy (and thereby to remove the artificial barrier it created in the marketplace), as well as damages in an amount to be proven at trial (subject to trebling under the Clayton Act).

### Count III – Violation of California Business & Professions Code § 17200 **et seq.** – Unfair Competition (Unlawful and Unfair Business Practices)

32. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

33. **Unlawful Prong:** Google’s conduct as alleged above constitutes “unlawful” business practices under California’s Unfair Competition Law (UCL), Business & Professions Code § 17200 **et seq.** The **unlawful** prong of the UCL is violated by any business act or practice that is forbidden by law. Here, Google’s actions violate federal antitrust laws (Sherman Act § 1 and § 2, as set forth in Counts I and II). These violations of law serve as predicate unlawful acts for the UCL. Thus, by engaging in contractual restraints of trade and monopolistic practices, Google has engaged in unlawful business practices under § 17200.

34. **Unfair Prong:** Independently, Google’s conduct also constitutes “unfair” business acts or practices under the UCL. Google’s policy and its enforcement offend established public policies and are unethical, oppressive, and injurious to consumers and competitors. California law recognizes as “unfair” any practice whose harm to competition outweighs its benefits. Here, the harm to competition and innovation caused by Google’s restrictive terms is substantial and far outweighs any purported utility. The policy impedes the development of new technologies and stifles the competitive process, contrary to the spirit and policy of both federal and California antitrust laws (which the UCL is meant to uphold). Even if Google’s conduct were not adjudicated as a Sherman Act violation for any reason, it would still be “unfair” under the UCL because it **threatens incipient violation of antitrust law and has effects comparable to an antitrust violation** (namely, reduced competition and consumer harm). The practice has also caused harm to Plaintiff (and other developers) that **is not outweighed by any countervailing benefits**. The only “benefit” is to Google’s own interest in insulating itself from competition, which is not a benefit that the law recognizes as legitimate.

35. **Fraudulent Prong (Not Alleged):** Plaintiff does not allege a claim under the “fraudulent” prong of § 17200 in this Complaint. The claim is based on unlawful and unfair conduct as described.

36. **Standing under UCL:** Plaintiff has standing to bring this claim because he has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of Google’s unfair competition. Plaintiff lost the value of investments made in his project, including (a) the money spent on Google Cloud services and other resources that were rendered wasted or less useful due to the policy, and (b) the economic value of his time and opportunity which could have led to a profitable outcome had he not been restrained by Google’s practice. Plaintiff also faces imminent threatened loss of money or property in the future if the policy remains (for example, he would either have to refrain from certain productive activities — losing potential revenue or progress — or risk losing access to Google services that are important for his work).

37. **Relief under UCL:** Pursuant to Business & Professions Code § 17203, Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to halt Google’s unfair competition, and any other equitable relief the Court deems just. This includes an order requiring Google to cease enforcement of, and to abrogate or modify, the unlawful contract terms that prohibit using generative AI output to develop other models. Additionally, to the extent Google has gained money or property by virtue of its unlawful practices (for example, if users paid for services under these restrictive terms), Plaintiff seeks restitution or disgorgement of such gains as allowed by law. Plaintiff, as a private party, does not seek civil penalties (which are reserved for government enforcement), but does seek the broad equitable powers of the Court to prevent ongoing and future harm from Google’s practices.

## Prayer for Relief

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Bo Shang prays that the Court grant the following relief against Defendant Google LLC:

* **Injunctive Relief:** A permanent injunction prohibiting Google, its officers, agents, employees, and all persons acting in concert with it, from enforcing or maintaining any term of service or policy that forbids users from using generative AI content output by Google’s services to develop or train other AI models. This injunctive relief should include an order requiring Google to **remove or amend** the offending provisions in its Terms of Service (including any Generative AI Additional Terms and similar policies) to make clear that users are permitted to utilize generative outputs for model development and training purposes. The injunction should further mandate that Google not take any retaliatory action (such as account suspension or legal threats under its terms) against users who engage in such lawful use of AI outputs.

* **Affirmative Actions:** An order requiring Google to notify users of the changes in terms and to educate its support staff and developers regarding the permissible use of generative AI outputs, so as to ensure compliance with the Court’s injunction and to dissipate the anti-competitive effects of the previous policy. (Plaintiff requests this relief to fully **“reset”** the marketplace expectations and to unclog the chilling effect on innovation that Google’s policy caused.)

* **Damages:** An award of damages in an amount to be determined at trial, to compensate Plaintiff for the injuries he sustained as a result of Google’s unlawful conduct. Such damages should include, but are not limited to, recovery for Plaintiff’s wasted expenditures, lost value of his development efforts, and other consequential losses incurred due to the delay and derailment of his AI project. Pursuant to Section 4 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. § 15), Plaintiff requests that any actual damages found be **trebled** (tripled) as provided by law, given that this action involves proven violations of the federal antitrust laws. (Although Plaintiff is pro se, he has been directly injured by the antitrust violations and thus is entitled to treble damages and costs.)

* **Attorneys’ Fees and Costs:** An award of Plaintiff’s costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees to the extent permitted by law (acknowledging that Plaintiff is self-represented, he seeks any costs or fees that may be awardable either to pro se litigants or that would incentivize legal representation if applicable). Under the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. § 15) and California Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5 (private attorney general doctrine), there are provisions for fee-shifting which Plaintiff seeks to invoke such that he is not financially burdened for vindicating important public rights in this litigation.

* **Restitution/Disgorgement (UCL Claim):** As to the UCL cause of action, any appropriate restitutionary relief to restore to Plaintiff (and, if the action is deemed suitable for broader relief, to similarly situated consumers or the public) any money or value that Google acquired through its unfair practices. This may include restitution of monies paid by users for Google services under the restrictive terms or disgorgement of ill-gotten gains attributable to the anti-competitive policy (to the extent such calculation is feasible), subject to proof at trial.

* **Declaratory Relief:** A declaration from the Court that Google’s contractual restriction against using generative AI outputs for developing other AI models is void, unenforceable, and unlawful. Such declaratory relief will clarify the rights and obligations of the parties and help ensure that Google cannot enforce similar anti-competitive terms in the future.

* **Other Relief:** Any and all other relief that the Court deems just and proper, including such other equitable or legal remedies that may be necessary to fully address and remedy the antitrust and unfair competition violations described above.

## Jury Demand

Plaintiff demands a trial by jury on all issues triable by a jury, including all claims and issues of fact. Plaintiff respectfully requests the opportunity to present his case to a jury of his peers as provided by the Seventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

*Dated:* May 4, 2025.
